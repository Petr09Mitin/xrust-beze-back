cr
there
s
a
mutie
look
out
at
the
shouted
warning
hugh
hoyland
ducked
with
nothing
to
spare
an
egg
sized
iron
missile
clanged
against
the
bulkhead
just
above
his
scalp
with
force
that
promised
a
fractured
skull
the
speed
with
which
he
crouched
had
lifted
his
feet
from
the
floor
plates
before
his
body
could
settle
slowly
to
the
deck
he
planted
his
feet
against
the
bulkhead
behind
him
and
shoved
he
went
shooting
down
the
passageway
in
a
long
flat
dive
his
knife
drawn
and
ready
he
twisted
in
the
air
checked
himself
with
his
feet
against
the
opposite
bulkhead
at
the
turn
in
the
passage
from
which
the
mutie
had
attacked
him
and
floated
lightly
to
his
feet
the
other
branch
of
the
passage
was
empty
his
two
companions
joined
him
sliding
awkwardly
across
the
floor
plates
is
it
gone
demanded
alan
mahoney
yes
agreed
hoyland
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
as
it
ducked
down
that
hatch
a
female
i
think
looked
like
it
had
four
legs
two
legs
or
four
we
ll
never
catch
it
now
commented
the
third
man
who
the
huff
wants
to
catch
it
protested
mahoney
i
don
t
well
i
do
for
one
said
hoyland
by
jordan
if
its
aim
had
been
two
inches
better
i
d
be
ready
for
the
converter
can
t
either
one
of
you
two
speak
three
words
without
swearing
the
third
man
disapproved
what
if
the
captain
could
hear
you
he
touched
his
forehead
reverently
as
he
mentioned
the
captain
oh
for
jordan
s
sake
snapped
hoyland
don
t
be
so
stuffy
mort
tyler
you
re
not
a
scientist
yet
i
reckon
i
m
as
devout
as
you
are
there
s
no
grave
sin
in
occasionally
giving
vent
to
your
feelings
even
the
scientists
do
it
i
ve
heard
em
tyler
opened
his
mouth
as
if
to
expostulate
then
apparently
thought
better
of
it
mahoney
touched
hoyland
on
the
arm
look
hugh
he
pleaded
let
s
get
out
of
here
we
ve
never
been
this
high
before
i
m
jumpy
i
want
to
get
back
down
to
where
i
can
feel
some
weight
on
my
feet
hoyland
looked
longingly
toward
the
hatch
through
which
his
assailant
had
disappeared
while
his
hand
rested
on
the
grip
of
his
knife
then
be
turned
to
mahoney
ok
kid
he
agreed
it
s
along
trip
down
anyhow
he
turned
and
slithered
back
toward
the
hatch
whereby
they
had
reached
the
level
where
they
now
were
the
other
two
following
him
disregarding
the
ladder
by
which
they
had
mounted
he
stepped
off
into
the
opening
and
floated
slowly
down
to
the
deck
fifteen
feet
below
tyler
and
mahoney
close
behind
him
another
hatch
staggered
a
few
feet
from
the
first
gave
access
to
a
still
lower
deck
down
down
down
and
still
farther
down
they
dropped
tens
and
dozens
of
decks
each
silent
dimly
lighted
mysterious
each
time
they
fell
a
little
faster
landed
a
little
harder
mahoney
protested
at
last
let
s
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
hugh
that
last
jump
hurt
my
feet
all
right
but
it
will
take
longer
how
far
have
we
got
to
go
anybody
keep
count
we
ve
got
about
seventy
decks
to
go
to
reach
farm
country
answered
tyler
how
d
you
know
demanded
mahoney
suspiciously
i
counted
them
stupid
and
as
we
came
down
i
took
one
away
for
each
deck
you
did
not
nobody
but
a
scientist
can
do
numbering
like
that
just
because
you
re
learning
to
read
and
write
you
think
you
know
everything
hoyland
cut
in
before
it
could
develop
into
a
quarrel
shut
up
alan
maybe
he
can
do
it
he
s
clever
about
such
things
anyhow
it
feels
like
about
seventy
decks
i
m
heavy
enough
maybe
he
d
like
to
count
the
blades
on
my
knife
stow
it
i
said
dueling
is
forbidden
outside
the
village
that
is
the
rule
they
proceeded
in
silence
running
lightly
down
the
stairways
until
increasing
weight
on
each
succeeding
level
forced
them
to
a
more
pedestrian
pace
presently
they
broke
through
into
a
level
that
was
quite
brilliantly
lighted
and
more
than
twice
as
deep
between
decks
as
the
ones
above
it
the
air
was
moist
and
warm
vegetation
obscured
the
view
well
down
at
last
said
hugh
i
don
t
recognize
this
farm
we
must
have
come
down
by
a
different
line
than
we
went
up
there
s
a
farmer
said
tyler
he
put
his
little
fingers
to
his
lips
and
whistled
then
called
hey
shipmate
where
are
we
the
peasant
looked
them
over
slowly
then
directed
them
in
reluctant
monosyllables
to
the
main
passageway
which
would
lead
them
back
to
their
own
village
a
brisk
walk
of
a
mile
and
a
half
down
a
wide
tunnel
moderately
crowded
with
traffic
travelers
porters
an
occasional
pushcart
a
dignified
scientist
swinging
in
a
litter
borne
by
four
husky
orderlies
and
preceded
by
his
master
at
arms
to
clear
the
common
crew
out
of
the
way
a
mile
and
a
half
of
this
brought
them
to
the
common
of
their
own
village
a
spacious
compartment
three
decks
high
and
perhaps
ten
times
as
wide
they
split
up
and
went
their
own
ways
hugh
to
his
quarters
in
the
barracks
of
the
cadets
young
bachelors
who
do
not
live
with
their
parents
he
washed
himself
and
went
thence
to
the
compartments
of
his
uncle
for
whom
he
worked
for
his
meals
his
aunt
glanced
up
as
he
came
in
but
said
nothing
as
became
a
woman
his
uncle
said
hello
hugh
been
exploring
again
good
eating
uncle
yes
his
uncle
a
stolid
sensible
man
looked
tolerantly
amused
where
did
you
go
and
what
did
you
find
hugh
s
aunt
had
slipped
silently
out
of
the
compartment
and
now
returned
with
his
supper
which
she
placed
before
him
he
fell
to
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
thank
her
he
munched
a
bite
before
replying
up
we
climbed
almost
to
the
level
of
no
weight
a
mutie
tried
to
crack
my
skull
his
uncle
chuckled
you
ll
find
your
death
in
those
passageways
lad
better
you
should
pay
more
attention
to
my
business
against
the
day
when
i
die
and
get
out
of
your
way
hugh
looked
stubborn
don
t
you
have
any
curiosity
uncle
me
oh
i
was
prying
enough
when
i
was
a
lad
i
followed
the
main
passage
all
the
way
around
and
back
to
the
village
right
through
the
dark
sector
i
went
with
muties
tagging
my
heels
see
that
scar
hugh
glanced
at
it
perfunctorily
he
had
seen
it
many
times
before
and
heard
the
story
repeated
to
boredom
once
around
the
ship
pfft
he
wanted
to
go
everywhere
see
everything
and
find
out
the
why
of
things
those
upper
levels
now
if
men
were
not
intended
to
climb
that
high
why
had
jordan
created
them
but
he
kept
his
own
counsel
and
went
on
with
his
meal
his
uncle
changed
the
subject
i
ve
occasion
to
visit
the
witness
john
black
claims
i
owe
him
three
swine
want
to
come
along
why
no
i
guess
not
wait
i
believe
i
will
hurry
up
then
they
stopped
at
the
cadets
barracks
hugh
claiming
an
errand
the
witness
lived
in
a
small
smelly
compartment
directly
across
the
common
from
the
barracks
where
he
would
be
readily
accessible
to
any
who
had
need
of
his
talents
they
found
him
leaning
in
his
doorway
picking
his
teeth
with
a
fingernail
his
apprentice
a
pimply
faced
adolescent
with
an
intent
nearsighted
expression
squatted
behind
him
good
eating
said
hugh
s
uncle
good
eating
to
you
edard
hoyland
d
you
come
on
business
or
to
keep
an
old
man
company
both
hugh
s
uncle
returned
diplomatically
then
explained
his
errand
so
said
the
witness
well
the
contract
s
clear
enough
black
john
delivered
ten
bushels
of
oats
expecting
his
pay
in
a
pair
of
shoats
ed
brought
his
sow
to
breed
for
pig
john
gets
his
pay
when
the
pigs
grow
big
how
big
are
the
pigs
now
edard
hoyland
big
enough
acknowledged
hugh
s
uncle
but
black
john
claims
three
instead
of
two
tell
him
to
go
soak
his
head
the
witness
has
spoken
he
laughed
in
a
thin
high
cackle
the
two
gossiped
for
a
few
minutes
edard
hoyland
digging
into
his
recent
experiences
to
satisfy
the
old
man
s
insatiable
liking
for
details
hugh
kept
decently
silent
while
the
older
men
talked
but
when
his
uncle
turned
to
go
he
spoke
up
i
ll
stay
awhile
uncle
eh
suit
yourself
good
eating
witness
good
eating
edard
hoyland
i
ve
brought
you
a
present
witness
said
hugh
when
his
uncle
had
passed
out
of
hearing
let
me
see
it
hugh
produced
a
package
of
tobacco
which
he
had
picked
up
from
his
locker
at
the
barracks
the
witness
accepted
it
without
acknowledgment
then
tossed
it
to
his
apprentice
who
took
charge
of
it
come
inside
invited
the
witness
then
directed
his
speech
to
his
apprentice
here
you
fetch
the
cadet
a
chair
now
lad
he
added
as
they
sat
themselves
down
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
with
yourself
hugh
told
him
and
was
required
to
repeat
in
detail
all
the
incidents
of
his
more
recent
explorations
the
witness
complaining
the
meanwhile
over
his
inability
to
remember
exactly
everything
he
saw
you
youngsters
have
no
capacity
he
pronounced
no
capacity
even
that
lout
he
jerked
his
head
toward
the
apprentice
he
has
none
though
he
s
a
dozen
times
better
than
you
would
you
believe
it
he
can
t
soak
up
a
thousand
lines
a
day
yet
he
expects
to
sit
in
my
seat
when
i
am
gone
why
when
i
was
apprenticed
i
used
to
sing
myself
to
sleep
on
a
mere
thousand
lines
leaky
vessels
that
s
what
you
are
hugh
did
not
dispute
the
charge
but
waited
for
the
old
man
to
go
on
which
he
did
in
his
own
time
you
had
a
question
to
put
to
me
lad
in
a
way
witness
well
out
with
it
don
t
chew
your
tongue
did
you
ever
climb
all
the
way
up
to
no
weight
me
of
course
not
i
was
a
witness
learning
my
calling
i
had
the
lines
of
all
the
witnesses
before
me
to
learn
and
no
time
for
boyish
amusements
i
had
hoped
you
could
tell
me
what
i
would
find
there
well
now
that
s
another
matter
i
ve
never
climbed
but
i
hold
the
memories
of
more
climbers
than
you
will
ever
see
i
m
an
old
man
i
knew
your
father
s
father
and
his
grandsire
before
that
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
well
what
was
it
be
wanted
to
know
how
could
he
ask
a
question
that
was
no
more
than
a
gnawing
ache
in
his
breast
still
what
is
it
all
for
witness
why
are
there
all
those
levels
above
us
eh
how
s
that
jordan
s
name
son
i
m
a
witness
not
a
scientist
well
i
thought
you
must
know
i
m
sorry
but
i
do
know
what
you
want
is
the
lines
from
the
beginning
i
ve
heard
them
hear
them
again
all
your
answers
are
in
there
if
you
ve
the
wisdom
to
see
them
attend
me
no
this
is
a
chance
for
my
apprentice
to
show
off
his
learning
here
you
the
lines
from
the
beginning
and
mind
your
rhythm
the
apprentice
wet
his
lips
with
his
tongue
and
began
in
the
beginning
there
was
jordan
thinking
his
lonely
thoughts
alone
in
the
beginning
there
was
darkness
formless
dead
and
man
unknown
out
of
the
loneness
came
a
longing
out
of
the
longing
came
a
vision
out
of
the
dream
there
came
a
planning
out
of
the
plan
there
came
decision
jordan
s
hand
was
lifted
and
the
ship
was
born
mile
after
mile
of
snug
compartments
tank
by
tank
for
the
golden
corn
ladder
and
passage
door
and
locker
fit
for
the
needs
of
the
yet
unborn
he
looked
on
his
work
and
found
it
pleasing
meet
for
a
race
that
was
yet
to
be
he
thought
of
man
man
came
into
being
checked
his
thought
and
searched
for
the
key
man
untamed
would
shame
his
maker
man
unruled
would
spoil
the
plan
so
jordan
made
the
regulations
orders
to
each
single
man
each
to
a
task
and
each
to
a
station
serving
a
purpose
beyond
their
ken
some
to
speak
and
some
to
listen
order
came
to
the
ranks
of
men
crew
he
created
to
work
at
their
stations
scientists
to
guide
the
plan
over
them
all
he
created
the
captain
made
him
judge
of
the
race
of
man
thus
it
was
in
the
golden
age
jordan
is
perfect
all
below
him
lack
perfection
in
their
deeds
envy
greed
and
pride
of
spirit
sought
for
minds
to
lodge
their
seeds
one
there
was
who
gave
them
lodging
accursed
huff
the
first
to
sin
his
evil
counsel
stirred
rebellion
planted
doubt
where
it
had
not
been
blood
of
martyrs
stained
the
floor
plates
jordan
s
captain
made
the
trip
darkness
swallowed
up
the
old
man
gave
the
boy
the
back
of
his
hand
sharp
across
the
mouth
try
again
from
the
beginning
no
from
where
you
missed
the
boy
hesitated
then
caught
his
stride
darkness
swallowed
ways
of
virtue
sin
prevailed
through
out
the
ship
the
boy
s
voice
droned
on
stanza
after
stanza
reciting
at
great
length
but
with
little
sharpness
of
detail
the
dim
old
story
of
sin
rebellion
and
the
time
of
darkness
how
wisdom
prevailed
at
last
and
the
bodies
of
the
rebel
leaders
were
fed
to
the
converter
how
some
of
the
rebels
escaped
making
the
trip
and
lived
to
father
the
muties
how
a
new
captain
was
chosen
after
prayer
and
sacrifice
hugh
stirred
uneasily
shuffling
his
feet
no
doubt
the
answers
to
his
questions
were
there
since
these
were
the
sacred
lines
but
he
had
not
the
wit
to
understand
them
why
what
was
it
all
about
was
there
really
nothing
more
to
life
than
eating
and
sleeping
and
finally
the
long
trip
didn
t
jordan
intend
for
him
to
understand
then
why
this
ache
in
his
breast
this
hunger
that
persisted
in
spite
of
good
eating
while
he
was
breaking
his
fast
after
sleep
an
orderly
came
to
the
door
of
his
uncle
s
compartments
the
scientist
requires
the
presence
of
hugh
hoyland
be
recited
glibly
hugh
knew
that
the
scientist
referred
to
was
lieutenant
nelson
in
charge
of
the
spiritual
and
physical
welfare
of
the
ship
s
sector
which
included
hugh
s
flative
vilage
he
bolted
the
last
of
his
breakfast
and
hurried
after
the
messenger
cadet
hoyland
he
was
announced
the
scientist
locked
up
from
his
own
meal
and
said
oh
yes
come
in
my
boy
sit
down
have
you
eaten
hugh
acknowjedged
that
he
had
but
his
eyes
rested
with
interest
on
the
fancy
fruit
in
front
of
his
superior
nelson
followed
his
glance
try
some
of
these
figs
they
re
a
new
mutation
i
had
them
brought
all
the
way
from
the
far
side
go
ahead
a
man
your
age
always
has
somewhere
to
stow
a
few
more
bites
hugh
accepted
with
much
self
consciousness
never
before
had
he
eaten
in
the
presence
of
a
scientist
the
elder
leaned
back
in
his
chair
wiped
his
fingers
on
his
shirt
arranged
his
beard
and
started
in
i
haven
t
seen
you
lately
son
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
with
yourself
before
hugh
could
reply
he
went
on
no
don
t
tell
me
i
will
tell
you
for
one
thing
you
have
been
exploring
climbing
without
too
much
respect
for
the
forbidden
areas
is
it
not
so
he
held
the
young
man
s
eye
hugh
fumbled
for
a
reply
but
he
was
let
off
again
never
mind
i
know
and
you
know
that
i
know
i
am
not
too
displeased
but
it
has
brought
it
forcibly
to
my
attention
that
it
is
time
that
you
decided
what
you
are
to
do
with
your
life
have
you
any
plans
well
no
definite
ones
sir
how
about
that
girl
edris
baxter
d
you
intend
to
marry
her
why
uh
i
don
t
know
sir
i
guess
i
want
to
and
her
father
is
willing
i
think
only
only
what
well
he
wants
me
to
apprentice
to
his
farm
i
suppose
it
s
a
good
idea
his
farm
together
with
my
uncle
s
business
would
make
a
good
property
but
you
re
not
sure
well
i
don
t
know
correct
you
re
not
for
that
i
have
other
plans
tell
me
have
you
ever
wondered
why
i
taught
you
to
read
and
write
of
course
you
have
but
you
ve
kept
your
own
counsel
that
is
good
now
attend
me
i
ve
watched
you
since
you
were
a
small
child
you
have
more
imagination
than
the
common
run
more
curiosity
more
go
and
you
are
a
born
leader
you
were
different
even
as
a
baby
your
head
was
too
large
for
one
thing
and
there
were
some
who
voted
at
your
birth
inspection
to
put
you
at
once
into
the
converter
but
i
held
them
off
i
wanted
to
see
how
you
would
turn
out
a
peasant
life
is
not
for
the
likes
of
you
you
are
to
be
a
scientist
the
old
man
paused
and
studied
his
face
hugh
was
confused
speechless
nelson
went
on
oh
yes
yes
indeed
for
a
man
of
your
temperament
there
are
only
two
things
to
do
with
him
make
him
one
of
the
custodians
or
send
him
to
the
converter
do
you
mean
sir
that
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
it
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
bluntly
yes
to
leave
the
bright
ones
among
the
ranks
of
the
crew
is
to
breed
heresy
we
can
t
have
that
we
had
it
once
and
it
almost
destroyed
tbe
human
race
you
have
marked
yourself
out
by
your
exceptional
ability
you
must
now
be
instructed
in
right
thinking
be
initiated
into
the
mysteries
in
order
that
you
may
be
a
conserving
force
rather
than
a
focus
of
infection
and
a
source
of
trouble
the
orderly
reappeared
loaded
down
with
bundles
which
he
dumped
on
the
deck
hugh
glanced
at
them
then
burst
out
why
those
are
my
things
certainly
acknowledged
nelson
i
sent
for
them
you
re
to
sleep
here
henceforth
i
ll
see
you
later
and
start
you
on
your
studies
unless
you
have
something
more
on
your
mind
why
no
sir
i
guess
not
i
must
admit
i
am
a
little
confused
i
suppose
i
suppose
this
means
you
don
t
want
me
to
marry
oh
that
nelson
answered
indifferently
take
her
if
you
like
her
father
can
t
protest
now
but
let
me
warn
you
you
ll
grow
tired
of
her
hugh
hoyland
devoured
the
ancient
books
that
his
mentor
permitted
him
to
read
and
felt
no
desire
for
many
many
sleeps
to
go
climbing
or
even
to
stir
out
of
nelson
s
cabin
more
than
once
he
felt
that
he
was
on
the
track
of
the
secret
a
secret
as
yet
undefined
even
as
a
question
but
again
he
would
find
himself
more
confused
than
ever
it
was
evidently
harder
to
reach
the
wisdom
of
scientisthood
than
he
had
thought
once
while
he
was
worrying
away
at
the
curious
twisted
characters
of
the
ancients
and
trying
to
puzzle
out
their
odd
rhetoric
and
unfamiliar
terms
nelson
came
into
the
little
compartment
that
had
been
set
aside
for
him
and
laying
a
fatherly
hand
on
his
shoulder
asked
how
goes
it
boy
why
well
enough
sir
i
suppose
he
answered
laying
the
book
aside
some
of
it
is
not
quite
clear
to
me
not
clear
at
all
to
tell
the
truth
that
is
to
be
expected
the
old
man
said
equably
i
ve
let
you
struggle
along
by
yourself
at
first
in
order
that
you
may
see
the
traps
that
native
wit
alone
will
fall
into
many
of
these
things
are
not
to
be
understood
without
instruction
what
have
you
there
he
picked
up
the
book
and
glanced
at
it
it
was
inscribed
basic
modern
physics
so
this
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
of
the
sacred
writings
yet
the
uninitiate
could
not
possibly
make
good
use
of
it
without
help
the
first
thing
that
you
must
understand
my
boy
is
that
our
forefathers
for
all
their
spiritual
perfection
did
not
look
at
things
in
the
fashion
in
which
we
do
they
were
incurable
romantics
rather
than
rationalists
as
we
are
and
the
truths
which
they
handed
down
to
us
though
strictly
true
were
frequently
clothed
in
allegorical
language
for
example
have
you
come
to
the
law
of
gravitation
i
read
about
it
did
you
understand
it
no
i
can
see
that
you
didn
t
well
said
hugh
defensively
it
didn
t
seem
to
mean
anything
it
just
sounded
silly
if
you
will
pardon
me
sir
that
illustrates
my
point
you
were
thinking
of
it
in
literal
terms
like
the
laws
governing
electrical
devices
found
elsewhere
in
this
same
book
two
bodies
attract
each
other
directly
as
the
product
of
their
masses
and
inversely
as
the
square
of
their
distance
it
sounds
like
a
rule
for
simple
physical
facts
does
it
not
yet
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
it
was
the
poetical
way
the
old
ones
bad
of
expressing
the
rule
of
propinquity
which
governs
the
emotion
of
love
the
bodies
referred
to
are
human
bodies
mass
is
their
capacity
for
love
young
people
have
a
greater
capacity
for
love
than
the
elderly
when
they
are
thrown
together
they
fall
in
love
yet
when
they
are
separated
they
soon
get
over
it
out
of
sight
out
of
mind
it
s
as
simple
as
that
but
you
were
seeking
some
deep
meaning
for
it
hugh
grinned
i
never
thought
of
looking
at
it
that
way
i
can
see
that
i
am
going
to
need
a
lot
of
help
is
there
anything
else
bothering
you
just
now
well
yes
lots
of
things
though
i
probably
can
t
remember
them
offhand
i
mind
one
thing
tell
me
father
can
muties
be
considered
as
being
people
i
can
see
you
have
been
listening
to
idle
talk
the
answer
to
that
is
both
yes
and
no
it
is
true
that
the
niuties
originally
descended
from
people
but
they
are
no
longer
part
of
the
crew
they
cannot
now
be
considered
as
members
of
the
human
race
for
they
have
flouted
jordan
s
law
this
is
a
broad
subject
he
went
on
settling
down
to
it
there
is
even
some
question
as
to
the
original
meaning
of
the
word
mutie
certainly
they
number
among
their
ancestors
the
mutineers
who
escaped
death
at
the
time
of
the
rebellion
but
they
also
have
in
their
blood
the
blood
of
many
of
the
mutants
who
were
born
during
the
dark
age
you
understand
of
course
that
during
that
period
our
present
wise
rule
of
inspecting
each
infant
for
the
mark
of
sin
and
returning
to
the
converter
any
who
are
found
to
be
mutations
was
not
in
force
there
are
strange
and
horrible
things
crawling
through
the
dark
passageways
and
lurking
in
the
deserted
levels
hugh
thought
about
it
for
a
while
then
asked
why
is
it
that
mutations
still
show
up
among
us
the
people
that
is
simple
the
seed
of
sin
is
still
in
us
from
time
to
time
it
still
shows
up
incarnate
in
destroying
those
monsters
we
help
to
cleanse
the
stock
and
thereby
bring
closer
the
culmination
of
jordan
s
plan
the
end
of
the
trip
at
our
heavenly
home
far
centaurus
hoyland
s
brow
wrinkled
again
that
is
another
thing
that
i
don
t
understand
many
of
these
ancient
writings
speak
of
the
trip
as
if
it
were
an
actual
moving
a
going
somewhere
as
if
the
ship
itself
were
no
more
than
a
pushcart
how
can
that
be
nelson
chuckled
how
can
it
indeed
how
can
that
move
which
is
the
background
against
which
all
else
moves
the
answer
of
course
is
plain
you
have
again
mistaken
allegorical
language
for
the
ordinary
usage
of
everyday
speech
of
course
the
ship
is
solid
immovable
in
a
physical
sense
how
can
the
whole
universe
move
yet
it
does
move
in
a
spiritual
sense
with
every
righteous
act
we
move
closer
to
the
sublime
destination
of
jordan
s
plan
hugh
nodded
i
think
i
see
of
course
it
is
conceivable
that
jordan
could
have
fashioned
the
world
in
some
other
shape
than
the
ship
had
it
suited
his
purpose
when
man
was
younger
and
more
poetical
holy
men
vied
with
one
another
in
inventing
fanciful
worlds
which
jordan
might
have
created
one
school
invented
an
entire
mythology
of
a
topsy
turvy
world
of
endless
reaches
of
space
empty
save
for
pinpoints
of
light
and
bodiless
mythological
monsters
they
called
it
the
heavenly
world
or
heaven
as
if
to
contrast
it
with
the
solid
reality
of
the
ship
they
seemed
never
to
tire
of
speculating
about
it
inventing
details
for
it
and
of
outlining
pictures
of
what
they
conceived
it
to
be
like
i
suppose
they
did
it
to
the
greater
glory
of
jordan
and
who
is
to
say
that
he
found
their
dreams
unacceptable
but
in
this
modern
age
we
have
more
serious
work
to
do
hugh
was
not
interested
in
astronomy
even
his
untutored
mind
had
been
able
to
see
in
its
wild
extravagance
an
intention
not
literal
he
turned
to
problems
nearer
at
hand
since
the
muties
are
the
seed
of
sin
why
do
we
make
no
effort
to
wipe
them
out
would
not
that
be
an
act
that
would
speed
the
plan
the
old
man
considered
a
while
before
replying
that
is
a
fair
question
and
deserves
a
straight
answer
since
you
are
to
be
a
scientist
you
will
need
to
know
the
answer
look
at
it
this
way
there
is
a
definite
limit
to
the
number
of
crew
the
ship
can
support
if
our
numbers
increase
without
limit
there
comes
a
time
when
there
will
not
be
good
eating
for
all
of
us
is
it
not
better
that
some
should
die
in
brushes
with
the
muties
than
that
we
should
grow
in
numbers
until
we
killed
each
other
for
food
the
ways
of
jordan
are
inscrutable
even
the
muties
have
a
part
in
his
plan
it
seemed
reasonable
but
hugh
was
not
sure
but
when
hugh
was
transferred
to
active
work
as
a
junior
scientist
in
the
operation
of
the
ship
s
functions
he
found
there
were
other
opinions
as
was
customary
he
put
in
a
period
serving
the
converter
the
work
was
not
onerous
he
had
principally
to
check
in
the
waste
materials
brought
in
by
porters
from
each
of
the
villages
keep
books
of
their
contributions
and
make
sure
that
no
redemable
metal
was
introduced
into
the
first
stage
hopper
but
it
brought
him
into
contact
with
bill
ertz
the
assistant
chief
engineer
a
man
not
much
older
than
himself
he
discussed
with
him
the
things
he
had
learned
from
nelson
and
was
shocked
at
ertz
s
attitude
get
this
through
your
head
kid
ertz
told
him
this
is
a
practical
job
for
practical
men
forget
all
that
romantic
nonsense
jordan
s
plan
that
stuff
is
all
right
to
keep
the
peasants
quiet
and
in
their
place
but
don
t
fall
for
it
yourself
there
is
no
plan
other
than
our
own
plans
for
looking
out
for
ourselves
the
ship
has
to
have
light
and
heat
and
power
for
cooking
and
irrigation
the
crew
can
t
get
along
without
those
things
and
that
makes
us
boss
of
the
crew
as
for
this
softheaded
tolerance
toward
the
muties
you
re
going
to
see
some
changes
made
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
string
along
with
us
it
impressed
on
him
that
he
was
expected
to
maintain
a
primary
loyalty
to
the
bloc
of
younger
men
among
the
scientists
they
were
a
well
knit
organization
within
an
organization
and
were
made
up
of
practical
hardheaded
men
who
were
working
toward
improvement
of
conditions
throughout
the
ship
as
they
saw
them
they
were
well
knit
because
an
apprentice
who
failed
to
see
things
their
way
did
not
last
long
either
he
failed
to
measure
up
and
soon
found
himself
back
in
the
ranks
of
the
peasants
or
as
was
more
likely
suffered
some
mishap
and
wound
up
in
the
converter
and
hoyland
began
to
see
that
they
were
right
they
were
realists
the
ship
was
the
ship
it
was
a
fact
requiring
no
explanation
as
for
jordan
who
had
ever
seen
him
spoken
to
him
what
was
this
nebulous
plan
of
his
the
object
of
life
was
living
a
man
was
born
lived
his
life
and
then
went
to
the
converter
it
was
as
simple
as
that
no
mystery
to
it
no
sublime
trip
and
no
centaurus
these
romantic
stories
were
simply
hangovers
from
the
childhood
of
the
race
before
men
gained
the
understanding
and
the
courage
to
look
facts
in
the
face
he
ceased
bothering
his
head
about
astronomy
and
mystical
physics
and
all
the
other
mass
of
mythology
he
bad
been
taught
to
revere
he
was
still
amused
more
or
less
by
the
lines
from
the
beginning
and
by
all
the
old
stories
about
earth
what
the
huff
was
earth
anyhow
but
now
realized
that
such
things
could
be
taken
seriously
only
by
children
and
dullards
besides
there
was
work
to
do
the
younger
men
while
still
maintaining
the
nominal
authority
of
their
elders
had
plans
of
their
own
the
first
of
which
was
a
systematic
extermination
of
the
muties
beyond
that
their
intentions
were
still
fluid
but
they
contemplated
making
full
use
of
the
resources
of
the
ship
including
the
upper
levels
the
young
men
were
able
to
move
ahead
with
their
plans
without
an
open
breach
with
their
elders
because
the
older
scientists
simply
did
not
bother
to
any
great
extent
with
the
routine
of
the
ship
the
present
captain
had
grown
so
fat
that
he
rarely
stirred
from
his
cabin
his
aide
one
of
the
young
men
s
bloc
attended
to
affairs
for
him
hoyland
never
laid
eyes
on
the
chief
engineer
save
once
when
he
showed
up
for
the
purely
religious
ceremony
of
manning
landing
stations
the
project
of
cleaning
out
the
muties
required
reconnaissance
of
the
upper
levels
to
be
done
systematically
it
was
in
carrying
out
such
scouting
that
hugh
hoyland
was
again
ambushed
by
a
mutie
this
mutie
was
more
accurate
with
his
slingshot
hoyland
s
companions
forced
to
retreat
by
superior
numbers
left
him
for
dead
joe
jim
gregory
was
playing
himself
a
game
of
checkers
time
was
when
they
had
played
cards
together
but
joe
the
head
on
the
right
had
suspected
jim
the
left
hand
member
of
the
team
of
cheating
they
had
quarreled
about
it
then
given
it
up
for
they
both
learned
early
in
their
joint
career
that
two
heads
on
one
pair
of
shoulders
must
necessarily
find
ways
of
getting
along
together
checkers
was
better
they
could
both
see
the
board
and
disagreement
was
impossible
a
loud
metallic
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
oompartment
interrupted
the
game
joe
jim
unsheathed
his
throwing
knife
and
cradled
it
ready
for
quick
use
come
in
roared
jim
the
door
opened
the
one
who
had
knocked
backed
into
the
room
the
only
safe
way
as
everyone
knew
to
enter
joe
jim
s
presence
the
newcomer
was
squat
and
rugged
and
powerful
not
over
four
feet
in
height
the
relaxed
body
of
a
man
hung
across
one
shoulder
and
was
steadied
by
a
hand
joe
jim
returned
the
knife
to
its
sheath
put
it
down
bobo
jim
ordered
and
close
the
door
added
joe
now
what
have
we
got
here
it
was
a
young
man
apparently
dead
though
no
wound
appeared
on
him
bobo
patted
a
thigh
eat
im
he
said
hopefully
saliva
spilled
out
of
his
still
opened
lips
maybe
temporized
jim
did
you
kill
him
bobo
shook
his
undersized
head
good
bobo
joe
approved
where
did
you
hit
him
bobo
hit
him
there
the
microcephalic
shoved
a
broad
thumb
against
the
supine
figure
in
the
area
between
the
umbilicus
and
the
breasthone
good
shot
joe
approved
we
couldn
t
have
done
better
with
a
knife
bobo
good
shot
the
dwarf
agreed
blandly
want
see
he
twitched
his
slingshot
invitingly
shut
up
answered
joe
not
unkindly
no
we
don
t
want
to
see
we
want
to
make
him
talk
bobo
fix
the
short
one
agreed
and
started
with
simple
brutality
to
carry
out
his
purpose
joe
jim
slapped
him
away
and
applied
other
methods
painful
but
considerably
less
drastic
than
those
of
the
dwarf
the
younger
man
jerked
and
opened
his
eyes
eat
im
repeated
bobo
no
said
joe
when
did
you
eat
last
inquired
jim
bobo
shook
his
head
and
rubbed
his
stomach
indicating
with
graphic
pantomime
that
it
had
been
a
long
time
too
long
joe
jim
went
over
to
a
locker
opened
it
and
withdrew
a
haunch
of
meat
he
held
it
up
jim
smelled
it
and
joe
drew
his
head
away
in
nose
wrinkling
disgust
joe
jim
threw
it
to
bobo
who
snatched
it
happily
out
of
the
air
now
get
out
ordered
jim
bobo
trotted
away
closing
the
door
behind
him
joejim
turned
to
the
captive
and
prodded
him
with
his
foot
speak
up
said
jim
who
the
huff
are
you
the
young
man
shivered
put
a
hand
to
his
head
then
seemed
suddenly
to
bring
his
surroundings
into
focus
for
be
scrambled
to
his
feet
moving
awkwardly
against
the
low
weight
conditions
of
this
level
and
reached
for
his
knife
it
was
not
at
his
belt
joe
jim
had
his
own
out
and
brandished
it
be
good
and
you
won
t
get
hurt
what
do
they
call
you
the
young
man
wet
his
lips
and
his
eyes
hurried
about
the
room
speak
up
said
joe
why
bother
with
him
inquired
jim
i
d
say
he
was
only
good
for
meat
better
call
bobo
back
no
hurry
about
that
joe
answered
i
want
to
talk
to
him
what
s
your
name
the
prisoner
looked
again
at
the
kife
and
muttered
hugh
hoyland
that
doesn
t
tell
us
much
jim
commented
what
d
you
do
what
village
do
you
come
from
and
what
were
you
doing
in
mutie
country
but
this
time
hoyland
was
sullen
even
the
prick
of
the
knife
against
his
ribs
caused
him
only
to
bite
his
lips
shucks
said
joe
he
s
only
a
stupid
peasant
let
s
drop
it
shall
we
finish
him
off
no
not
now
shut
him
up
joe
jim
opened
the
door
of
a
small
side
compartment
and
urged
hugh
in
with
the
knife
he
then
closed
and
fastened
the
door
and
went
back
to
his
game
your
move
jim
the
compartment
in
which
hugh
was
locked
was
dark
he
soon
satisfied
himself
by
touch
that
the
smooth
steel
walls
were
entirely
featureless
save
for
the
solid
securely
fastened
door
presently
he
lay
down
on
the
deck
and
gave
himself
up
to
fruitless
thinking
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
time
to
fall
asleep
and
awaken
more
than
once
and
time
to
grow
very
hungry
and
very
very
thirsty
when
joe
jim
next
took
sufficient
interest
in
his
prisoner
to
open
the
door
of
the
cell
hoyland
was
not
immediately
in
evidence
he
had
planned
many
times
what
he
would
do
when
the
door
opened
and
his
chance
came
but
when
the
event
arrived
he
was
too
weak
semi
comatose
joe
jim
dragged
him
out
the
disturbance
roused
him
to
partial
comprehension
he
sat
up
and
stared
around
him
ready
to
talk
asked
jim
hoyland
opened
his
mouth
but
no
words
came
out
can
t
you
see
he
s
too
dry
to
talk
joe
told
his
twin
then
to
hugh
will
you
talk
if
we
give
you
some
water
hoyland
looked
puzzled
then
nodded
vigorously
joe
jim
returned
in
a
moment
with
a
mug
of
water
hugh
drank
greedily
paused
and
seemed
about
to
faint
joe
jim
took
the
mug
from
him
that
s
enough
for
now
said
joe
tell
us
about
yourself
hugh
did
so
in
detail
being
prompted
from
time
to
time
by
questions
from
one
of
the
twins
or
a
kick
against
his
shin
hugh
accepted
a
de
facto
condition
of
slavery
with
no
particular
resistance
and
no
great
disturbance
of
soul
the
word
slave
was
not
in
his
vocabulary
but
the
condition
was
a
commonplace
in
everything
he
had
ever
known
there
had
always
been
those
who
gave
orders
and
those
who
carried
them
out
he
could
imagine
no
other
condition
no
other
type
of
social
organization
it
was
a
fact
of
life
though
naturally
he
thought
of
escape
thinking
about
it
was
as
far
as
he
got
joe
jim
guessed
his
thoughts
and
brought
the
matter
out
into
the
open
joe
told
him
don
t
go
getting
ideas
youngster
without
a
knife
you
wouldn
t
get
three
levels
away
in
this
part
of
the
ship
if
you
managed
to
steal
a
knife
from
me
you
still
wouldn
t
make
it
down
to
high
weight
besides
there
s
bobo
hugh
waited
a
moment
as
was
fitting
then
said
bobo
jim
grinned
and
replied
we
told
bobo
that
you
were
his
to
butcher
if
he
liked
if
you
ever
stuck
your
head
out
of
our
compartments
without
us
now
he
sleeps
outside
the
door
and
spends
a
lot
of
his
time
there
it
was
only
fair
put
in
joe
he
was
disappointed
when
we
decided
to
keep
you
say
suggested
jim
turning
his
bead
toward
his
brother
s
how
about
some
fun
he
turned
back
to
hugh
can
you
throw
a
knife
of
course
hugh
answered
let
s
see
you
here
joe
jim
handed
him
their
own
knife
hugh
accepted
it
jiggling
it
in
his
band
to
try
its
balance
try
my
mark
joe
jim
had
a
plastic
target
set
up
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
from
his
favorite
chair
on
which
he
was
wont
to
practice
his
own
skill
hugh
eyed
it
and
with
an
arm
motion
too
fast
to
follow
let
fly
he
used
the
economical
underhand
stroke
thumb
on
the
blade
fingers
together
the
blade
shivered
in
the
target
well
centered
in
the
chewed
up
area
which
marked
joe
jim
s
best
efforts
good
boy
joe
approved
what
do
you
have
in
mind
jim
let
s
give
him
the
knife
and
see
how
far
he
gets
no
said
joe
i
don
t
agree
why
not
if
bobo
wins
we
re
out
one
servant
if
hugh
wins
we
lose
both
bobo
and
him
it
s
wasteful
oh
well
if
you
insist
i
do
hugh
fetch
the
knife
hugh
did
so
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
turn
the
knife
against
joe
jim
the
master
was
the
master
for
servant
to
attack
master
was
not
simply
repugnant
to
good
morals
it
was
an
idea
so
wild
that
it
did
not
occur
to
him
at
all
hugh
had
expected
that
joe
jim
would
be
impressed
by
his
learning
as
a
scientist
it
did
not
work
out
that
way
joe
jim
especially
jim
loved
to
argue
they
sucked
hugh
dry
in
short
order
and
figuratively
cast
him
aside
hoyland
felt
humiliated
after
all
was
he
not
a
scientist
could
he
not
read
and
write
shut
up
jim
told
hugh
reading
is
simple
i
could
do
it
before
your
father
was
born
d
you
think
you
re
the
first
scientist
that
has
served
me
scientists
bah
a
pack
of
ignoramuses
in
an
attempt
to
re
establish
his
own
intellectual
conceit
hugh
expounded
the
theories
of
the
younger
scientists
the
strictly
matter
of
fact
hard
boiled
realism
which
rejected
all
religious
interpretation
and
took
the
ship
as
it
was
he
confidently
expected
joe
jim
to
approve
such
a
point
of
view
it
seemed
to
fit
their
temperaments
they
laughed
in
his
face
honest
jim
insisted
when
be
bad
ceased
snorting
are
you
young
punks
so
stupid
as
all
that
why
you
re
worse
than
your
elders
but
you
just
got
through
saying
hugh
protested
in
hurt
tones
that
all
our
accepted
religious
notions
are
so
much
bunk
that
is
just
what
my
friends
think
they
want
to
junk
all
that
old
nonsense
joe
started
to
speak
jim
cut
in
ahead
of
him
why
bother
with
him
joe
he
s
hopeless
no
he
s
not
i
m
enjoying
this
he
s
the
first
one
i
ve
talked
with
in
i
don
t
know
how
long
who
stood
any
chance
at
all
of
seeing
the
truth
let
us
be
i
want
to
see
whether
that
s
a
head
he
has
on
his
shoulders
or
just
a
place
to
hang
his
ears
o
k
jim
agreed
but
keep
it
quiet
i
m
going
to
take
a
nap
the
left
hand
head
closed
its
eyes
soon
it
was
snoring
joe
and
hugh
continued
their
discussion
in
whispers
the
trouble
with
you
youngsters
joe
said
is
that
if
you
can
t
understand
a
thing
right
off
you
think
it
can
t
be
true
the
trouble
with
your
elders
is
anything
they
didn
t
understand
they
reinterpreted
to
mean
something
else
and
then
thought
they
understood
it
none
of
you
has
tried
believing
clear
words
the
way
they
were
written
and
then
tried
to
understand
them
on
that
basis
oh
no
you
re
all
too
bloody
smart
for
that
if
you
can
t
see
it
right
off
it
ain
t
so
it
must
mean
something
different
what
do
you
mean
hugh
asked
suspiciously
well
take
the
trip
for
instance
what
does
it
mean
to
you
well
to
my
mind
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
it
s
just
a
piece
of
nonsense
to
impress
the
peasants
and
what
is
the
accepted
meaning
well
it
s
where
you
go
when
you
die
or
rather
what
you
do
you
make
the
trip
to
centaurus
and
what
is
centaurus
it
s
mind
you
i
m
just
telling
you
the
orthodox
answers
i
don
t
really
believe
this
stuff
it
s
where
you
arrive
when
you
ve
made
the
trip
a
place
where
everybody
s
happy
and
there
s
always
good
eating
joe
snorted
jim
broke
the
rhythm
of
his
snoring
opened
one
eye
and
settled
back
again
with
a
grunt
that
s
just
what
i
mean
joe
went
on
in
a
lower
whisper
you
don
t
use
your
head
did
it
over
occur
to
you
that
the
trip
was
just
what
the
old
books
said
it
was
the
ship
and
all
the
crew
actually
going
somewhere
moving
hoyland
thought
about
it
you
don
t
mean
for
me
to
take
you
seriously
physically
it
s
an
impossibility
the
ship
can
t
go
anywhere
it
already
is
everywhere
we
can
make
a
trip
through
it
but
the
trip
that
has
to
have
a
spiritual
meaning
if
it
has
any
joe
called
on
jordan
to
support
him
now
listen
he
said
get
this
through
that
thick
head
of
yours
imagine
a
place
a
lot
bigger
than
the
ship
a
lot
bigger
with
the
ship
inside
it
moving
d
you
get
it
hugh
tried
he
tried
very
hard
he
shook
his
bead
it
doesn
t
make
sense
he
said
there
can
t
be
anything
bigger
than
the
ship
there
wouldn
t
be
any
place
for
it
to
be
oh
for
huff
s
sake
listen
outside
the
ship
get
that
straight
down
beyond
the
level
in
every
direction
emptiness
out
there
understand
me
but
there
isn
t
anything
below
the
lowest
level
that
s
why
it
s
the
lowest
level
look
if
you
took
a
knife
and
started
digging
a
hole
in
the
floor
of
the
lowest
level
where
would
it
get
you
but
you
can
t
it
s
too
hard
but
suppose
you
did
and
it
made
a
hole
where
would
that
hole
go
imagine
it
hugh
shut
his
eyes
and
tried
to
imagine
digging
a
hole
in
the
lowest
level
digging
as
if
it
were
soft
soft
as
cheese
he
began
to
get
some
glimmering
of
a
possibility
a
possibility
that
was
unsettling
soul
shaking
he
was
falling
falling
into
a
hole
that
he
had
dug
which
had
no
levels
under
it
he
opened
his
eyes
very
quickly
that
s
awful
he
ejaculated
i
won
t
believe
it
joe
jim
got
up
i
ll
make
you
believe
it
he
said
grimly
if
i
have
to
break
your
neck
to
do
it
he
strode
over
to
the
outer
door
and
opened
it
bobo
he
shouted
bobo
jim
s
head
snapped
erect
wassa
matter
wha
s
going
on
we
re
going
to
take
hugh
to
no
weight
what
for
to
pound
some
sense
into
his
silly
head
some
other
time
no
i
want
to
do
it
now
all
right
all
right
no
need
to
shake
i
m
awake
now
anyhow
joe
jim
gregory
was
almost
as
nearly
unique
in
his
or
their
mental
ability
as
he
was
in
his
bodily
construction
under
any
circumstances
he
would
have
been
a
dominant
personality
among
the
muties
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
bully
them
order
them
about
and
live
on
their
services
had
he
had
the
will
to
power
it
is
conceivable
that
he
could
have
organized
the
muties
to
fight
and
overcome
the
crew
proper
but
he
lacked
that
drive
he
was
by
native
temperament
an
intellectual
a
bystander
an
observer
he
was
interested
in
the
how
and
the
why
but
his
will
to
action
was
satisfied
with
comfort
and
convenience
alone
had
he
been
born
two
normal
twins
and
among
the
crew
it
is
likely
that
he
would
have
drifted
into
scientisthood
as
the
easiest
and
most
satisfactory
answer
to
the
problem
of
living
and
as
such
would
have
entertained
himself
mildly
with
conversation
and
administration
as
it
was
he
lacked
mental
companionship
and
had
whiled
away
three
generations
reading
and
rereading
books
stolen
for
him
by
his
stooges
the
two
halves
of
his
dual
person
had
argued
and
discussed
what
they
had
read
and
had
almost
inevitably
arrived
at
a
reasonably
coherent
theory
of
history
and
the
physical
world
except
in
one
respect
the
concept
of
fiction
was
entirely
foreign
to
them
they
treated
the
novels
that
had
been
provided
for
the
jordan
expedition
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
that
they
did
text
and
reference
books
this
led
to
their
one
major
difference
of
opinion
jim
regarded
allan
quartermain
as
the
greatest
man
who
had
ever
lived
joe
held
out
for
john
henry
they
were
both
inordinately
fond
of
poetry
they
could
recite
page
after
page
of
kipling
and
were
nearly
as
fond
of
rhysling
the
blind
singer
of
the
spaceways
bobo
backed
in
joe
jim
hooked
a
thumb
toward
hugh
look
said
joe
he
s
going
out
now
said
bobo
happily
and
grinned
slavering
you
and
your
stomach
joe
answered
rapping
bobo
s
pate
with
his
knuckles
no
you
don
t
eat
him
you
and
him
blood
brothers
get
it
not
eat
im
no
fight
for
him
he
fights
for
you
o
k
the
pinhead
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
the
inevitable
blood
brothers
bobo
know
all
right
now
we
go
up
to
the
place
where
everybody
flies
you
go
ahead
and
make
lookout
they
climbed
in
single
file
the
dwarf
running
ahead
to
spot
the
lie
of
the
land
hoyland
behind
him
joe
jim
bringing
up
the
rear
joe
with
eyes
to
the
front
jim
watching
their
rear
head
turned
over
his
shoulder
higher
and
higher
they
went
weight
slipping
imperceptibly
from
them
with
each
successive
deck
they
emerged
finally
into
a
level
beyond
which
there
was
no
further
progress
no
opening
above
them
the
deck
curved
gently
suggesting
that
the
true
shape
of
the
space
was
a
giant
cylinder
but
overhead
a
metallic
expanse
which
exhibited
a
similar
curvature
obstructed
the
view
and
prevented
one
from
seeing
whether
or
not
the
deck
in
truth
curved
back
on
itself
there
were
no
proper
bulkheads
great
stanchions
so
huge
and
squat
as
to
give
an
impression
of
excessive
unnecessary
strength
grew
thickly
about
them
spacing
deck
and
overhead
evenly
apart
weight
was
imperceptible
if
one
remained
quietly
in
one
place
the
undetectable
residuum
of
weight
would
bring
the
body
in
a
gentle
drift
down
to
the
floor
but
up
and
down
were
terms
largely
lacking
in
meaning
hugh
did
not
like
it
it
made
him
gulp
but
bobo
seemed
delighted
by
it
and
not
unused
to
it
he
moved
through
the
air
like
an
uncouth
fish
banking
off
stanchion
floor
plate
and
overhead
as
suited
his
convenience
joe
jim
set
a
course
parallel
to
the
common
axis
of
the
inner
and
outer
cylinders
following
a
passageway
formed
by
the
orderly
spacing
of
the
stanchions
there
were
handrails
set
along
the
passage
one
of
which
he
followed
like
a
spider
on
its
thread
he
made
remarkable
speed
which
hugh
floundered
to
maintain
in
time
be
caught
the
trick
of
the
easy
effortless
overhand
pull
the
long
coast
against
nothing
but
air
resistance
and
the
occasional
flick
of
the
toes
or
the
hand
against
the
floor
but
he
was
much
too
busy
to
tell
how
far
they
went
before
they
stopped
miles
he
guessed
it
to
be
but
he
did
not
know
when
they
did
stop
it
was
because
the
passage
had
terminated
a
solid
bulkhead
stretching
away
to
right
and
left
barred
their
way
joe
jim
moved
along
it
to
the
right
searching
he
found
what
he
sought
a
man
sized
door
closed
its
presence
distinguishable
only
by
a
faint
crack
which
marked
its
outline
and
a
cursive
geometrical
design
on
its
surface
joe
jim
studied
this
and
scratched
his
right
hand
head
the
two
heads
whispered
to
each
other
joe
jim
raised
his
hand
in
an
awkward
gesture
no
no
said
jim
joe
jim
checked
himself
how
s
that
joe
answered
they
whispered
together
again
joe
nodded
and
joe
jim
again
raised
his
hand
he
traced
the
design
on
the
door
without
touching
it
moving
his
forefinger
through
the
air
perhaps
four
inches
from
the
surface
of
the
door
the
order
of
succession
in
which
his
finger
moved
over
the
lines
of
the
design
appeared
simple
but
certainly
not
obvious
finished
he
shoved
a
palm
against
the
adjacent
bulkhead
drifted
back
from
the
door
and
waited
a
moment
later
there
was
a
soft
almost
inaudible
insufflation
the
door
stirred
and
moved
outward
perhaps
six
inches
then
stopped
joe
jim
appeared
puzzled
he
ran
his
hands
cautiously
into
the
open
crack
and
pulled
nothing
happened
he
called
to
bobo
open
it
bobo
looked
the
situation
over
with
a
scowl
on
his
forehead
which
wrinkled
almost
to
his
crown
he
then
placed
his
feet
against
the
bulkhead
steadying
himself
by
grasping
the
door
with
one
hand
he
took
hold
of
the
edge
of
the
door
with
both
hands
settled
his
feet
firmly
bowed
his
body
and
strained
he
held
his
breath
chest
rigid
back
bent
sweat
breaking
out
from
the
effort
the
great
cords
in
his
neck
stood
out
making
of
his
head
a
misshapen
pyramid
hugh
could
hear
the
dwarf
s
joints
crack
it
was
easy
to
believe
that
he
would
kill
himself
with
the
attempt
too
stupid
to
give
up
but
the
door
gave
suddenly
with
a
plaint
of
binding
metal
as
the
door
in
swinging
out
slipped
from
bobo
s
fingers
the
unexpectedly
released
tension
in
his
legs
shoved
him
heavily
away
from
the
bulkhead
he
plunged
down
the
passageway
floundering
for
a
handhold
but
he
was
back
in
a
moment
drifting
awkwardly
through
the
air
as
he
massaged
a
cramped
calf
joe
jim
led
the
way
inside
hugh
close
behind
him
what
is
this
place
demanded
hugh
his
curiosity
overcoming
his
servant
manners
the
main
control
room
said
joe
main
control
room
the
most
sacred
and
taboo
place
in
the
ship
its
very
location
a
forgotten
mystery
in
the
credo
of
the
young
men
it
was
nonexistent
the
older
scientists
varied
in
their
attitude
between
fundamentalist
acceptance
and
mystical
belief
as
enlightened
as
hugh
believed
himself
to
be
the
very
words
frightened
him
the
control
room
why
the
very
spirit
of
jordan
was
said
to
reside
there
he
stopped
joe
jim
stopped
and
joe
looked
around
come
on
he
said
what
s
the
matter
why
uh
uh
speak
up
but
but
this
place
is
haunted
this
is
jordan
s
oh
for
jordan
s
sake
protested
joe
with
slow
exasperation
i
thought
you
told
me
you
young
punks
didn
t
take
any
stock
in
jordan
yes
but
but
this
is
stow
it
come
along
or
i
ll
have
bobo
drag
you
he
turned
away
hugh
followed
reluctantly
as
a
man
climbs
a
scaffold
they
threaded
through
a
passageway
just
wide
enough
for
two
to
use
the
handrails
abreast
the
passage
curved
in
a
wide
sweeping
arc
of
full
ninety
degrees
then
opened
into
the
control
room
proper
hugh
peered
past
joe
jim
s
broad
shoulders
fearful
but
curious
he
stared
into
a
well
lighted
room
huge
quite
two
hundred
feet
across
it
was
spherical
the
interior
of
a
great
globe
the
surface
of
the
globe
was
featureless
frosted
silver
in
the
geometrical
center
of
the
sphere
hugh
saw
a
group
of
apparatus
about
fifteen
feet
across
to
his
inexperienced
eye
it
was
completely
unintelligible
he
could
not
have
described
it
but
he
saw
that
it
floated
steadily
with
no
apparent
support
running
from
the
end
of
the
passage
to
the
mass
at
the
center
of
the
globe
was
a
tube
of
metal
latticework
wide
as
the
passage
itself
it
offered
the
only
exit
from
the
passage
joe
jim
turned
to
bobo
and
ordered
him
to
remain
in
the
passageway
then
entered
the
tube
he
pulled
himself
along
it
hand
over
hand
the
bars
of
the
latticework
making
a
ladder
hugh
followed
him
they
emerged
into
the
mass
of
apparatus
occupying
the
center
of
the
sphere
seen
close
up
the
gear
of
the
control
station
resolved
itself
into
its
individual
details
but
it
still
made
no
sense
to
him
he
glanced
away
from
it
to
the
inner
surface
of
the
globe
which
surrounded
them
that
was
a
mistake
the
surface
of
the
globe
being
featureless
silvery
white
had
nothing
to
lend
it
perspective
it
might
have
been
a
hundred
feet
away
or
a
thousand
or
many
miles
he
had
never
experienced
an
unbroken
height
greater
than
that
between
two
decks
nor
an
open
space
larger
than
the
village
common
he
was
panic
stricken
scared
out
of
his
wits
the
more
so
in
that
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
he
feared
but
the
ghost
of
long
forgotten
jungle
ancestors
possessed
him
and
chilled
his
stomach
with
the
basic
primitive
fear
of
falling
he
clutched
at
the
control
gear
clutched
at
joe
jim
joe
jim
let
him
have
one
hard
across
the
mouth
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
what
s
the
matter
with
you
growled
jim
i
don
t
know
hugh
presently
managed
to
get
out
i
don
t
know
but
i
don
t
like
this
place
let
s
get
out
of
here
jim
lifted
his
eyebrows
to
joe
looked
disgusted
and
said
we
might
as
well
that
weak
bellied
baby
will
never
understand
anything
you
tell
him
oh
he
ll
be
all
right
joe
replied
dismissing
the
matter
hugh
climb
into
one
of
the
chairs
there
that
one
in
the
meantime
hugh
s
eyes
had
fallen
on
the
tube
whereby
they
had
reached
the
control
center
and
had
followed
it
back
by
eye
to
the
passage
door
the
sphere
suddenly
shrank
to
its
proper
focus
and
the
worst
of
his
panic
was
over
he
complied
with
the
order
still
trembling
but
able
to
obey
the
control
center
consisted
of
a
rigid
framework
made
up
of
chairs
or
frames
to
receive
the
bodies
of
the
operators
and
consolidated
instrument
and
report
panels
mounted
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
be
almost
in
the
laps
of
the
operators
where
they
were
readily
visible
but
did
not
obstruct
the
view
the
chairs
had
high
supporting
sides
or
arms
and
mounted
in
these
aims
were
the
controls
appropriate
to
each
officer
on
watch
but
hugh
was
not
yet
aware
of
that
he
slid
under
the
instrument
panel
into
his
seat
and
settled
back
glad
of
its
enfolding
stability
it
fitted
him
in
a
semi
reclining
position
footrest
to
head
support
but
something
was
happening
on
the
panel
in
front
of
joe
jim
he
caught
it
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
turned
to
look
bright
red
letters
glowed
near
the
top
of
the
board
2nd
astrogator
posted
what
was
a
second
astrogator
he
didn
t
know
then
he
noticed
that
the
extreme
top
of
his
own
board
was
labeled
2nd
astrogator
and
concluded
it
must
be
himself
or
rather
the
man
who
should
be
sitting
there
he
felt
momentarily
uncomfortable
that
the
proper
second
astrogator
might
come
in
and
find
him
usurping
his
post
but
he
put
it
out
of
his
mind
it
seemed
unlikely
but
what
was
a
second
astrogator
anyhow
the
letters
faded
from
joe
jim
s
board
a
red
dot
appeared
on
the
left
hand
edge
and
remained
joe
jim
did
something
with
his
right
hand
his
board
reported
acceleration
zero
then
main
drive
the
last
two
words
blinked
several
times
then
were
replaced
with
no
report
these
words
faded
out
and
a
bright
green
dot
appeared
near
the
right
hand
edge
get
ready
said
joe
looking
toward
hugh
the
light
is
going
out
you
re
not
going
to
turn
out
the
light
protested
hugh
no
you
are
take
a
look
by
your
left
hand
see
those
little
white
lights
hugh
did
so
and
found
shining
up
through
the
surface
the
chair
arm
little
beads
of
light
arrayed
to
form
two
squares
one
above
the
other
each
one
controls
the
light
of
one
quadrant
explained
joe
cover
them
with
your
hand
to
turn
out
the
light
go
ahead
do
it
reluctantly
but
fascinated
hugh
did
as
he
was
directed
he
placed
a
palm
over
the
tiny
lights
and
waited
the
silvery
sphere
turned
to
dull
lead
faded
still
more
leaving
them
in
darkness
complete
save
for
the
silent
glow
from
the
instrument
panels
hugh
felt
nervous
but
exhilarated
he
withdrew
his
palm
the
sphere
remained
dark
the
eight
little
lights
had
turned
blue
now
said
joe
i
m
going
to
show
you
the
stars
in
the
darkness
joe
jim
s
right
hand
slid
over
another
pattern
of
eight
lights
creation
faithfully
reproduced
shining
as
steady
and
serene
from
the
walls
of
the
stellarium
as
did
their
originals
from
the
black
deeps
of
space
the
mirrored
stars
looked
down
on
him
light
after
jeweled
light
scattered
in
careless
bountiful
splendor
across
the
simulacrum
sky
the
countless
suns
lay
before
him
before
him
over
him
under
him
behind
him
in
every
direction
from
him
he
hung
alone
in
the
center
of
the
stellar
universe
oooooh
it
was
an
involuntary
sound
caused
by
his
indrawn
breath
he
clutched
the
chair
arms
hard
enough
to
break
fingernails
but
he
was
not
aware
of
it
nor
was
he
afraid
at
the
moment
there
was
room
in
his
being
for
but
one
emotion
life
within
the
ship
alternately
harsh
and
workaday
had
placed
no
strain
on
his
innate
capacity
to
experience
beauty
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
knew
the
intolerable
ecstasy
of
beauty
unalloyed
it
shook
him
and
hurt
him
like
the
first
trembling
intensity
of
sex
it
was
some
time
before
hugh
sufficiently
recovered
from
the
shock
and
the
ensuing
intense
preoccupation
to
be
able
to
notice
jim
s
sardonic
laugh
joe
s
dry
chuckle
had
enough
inquired
joe
without
waiting
for
a
reply
joe
jim
turned
the
lights
back
on
using
the
duplicate
controls
mounted
in
the
left
arm
of
his
chair
hugh
sighed
his
chest
ached
and
his
heart
pounded
he
realized
suddenly
that
he
had
been
holding
his
breath
the
entire
time
that
the
lights
had
been
turned
out
well
smart
boy
asked
jim
are
you
convinced
hugh
sighed
again
not
knowing
why
with
the
lights
back
on
he
felt
safe
and
snug
again
but
was
possessed
of
a
deep
sense
of
personal
loss
he
knew
subconsciously
that
having
seen
the
stars
he
would
never
be
happy
again
the
dull
ache
in
his
breast
the
vague
inchoate
yearning
for
his
lost
heritage
of
open
sky
and
stars
was
never
to
be
silenced
even
though
he
was
yet
too
ignorant
to
be
aware
of
it
at
the
top
of
his
mind
what
was
it
he
asked
in
a
hushed
voice
that
s
answered
joe
that
s
the
world
that
s
the
universe
that
s
what
we
ve
been
trying
to
tell
you
about
hugh
tried
furiously
to
force
his
inexperienced
mind
to
comprehend
that
s
what
you
mean
by
outside
he
asked
all
those
beautiful
little
lights
sure
said
joe
only
they
aren
t
little
they
re
a
long
way
off
you
see
maybe
thousands
of
miles
what
sure
sure
joe
persisted
there
s
lots
of
room
out
there
space
it
s
big
why
some
of
those
stars
may
be
as
big
as
the
ship
maybe
bigger
hugh
s
face
was
a
pitiful
study
in
overstrained
imagination
bigger
than
the
ship
he
repeated
but
but
jim
tossed
his
head
impatiently
and
said
to
joe
wha
d
i
tell
you
you
re
wasting
our
time
on
this
lunk
he
hasn
t
got
the
capacity
easy
jim
joe
answered
mildly
don
t
expect
him
to
run
before
he
can
crawl
it
took
us
a
long
time
i
seem
to
remember
that
you
were
a
little
slow
to
believe
your
own
eyes
that
s
a
lie
said
jim
nastily
you
were
the
one
that
had
to
be
convinced
o
k
o
k
joe
conceded
let
it
ride
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
both
had
it
all
straight
hoyland
paid
little
attention
to
the
exchange
between
the
two
brothers
it
was
a
usual
thing
his
attention
was
centered
on
matters
decidedly
not
usual
joe
he
asked
what
became
of
the
ship
while
we
were
looking
at
the
stars
did
we
stare
right
through
it
not
exactly
joe
told
him
you
weren
t
looking
directly
at
the
stars
at
all
but
at
a
kind
of
picture
of
them
it
s
like
well
they
do
it
with
mirrors
sort
of
i
ve
got
a
book
that
tells
about
it
but
you
can
see
em
directly
volunteered
jim
his
momentary
pique
forgotten
there
s
a
compartment
forward
of
here
oh
yes
put
in
joe
it
slipped
my
mind
the
captain
s
veranda
he
s
got
one
all
of
glass
you
can
look
right
out
the
captain
s
veranda
but
not
this
captain
he
s
never
been
near
the
place
that
s
the
name
over
the
door
of
the
compartment
what
s
a
veranda
blessed
if
i
know
it
s
just
the
name
of
the
place
will
you
take
me
up
there
joe
appeared
to
be
about
to
agree
but
jim
cut
in
some
other
time
i
want
to
get
back
i
m
hungry
they
passed
back
through
the
tube
woke
up
bobo
and
made
the
long
trip
back
down
it
was
long
before
hugh
could
persuade
joe
jim
to
take
him
exploring
again
but
the
time
intervening
was
well
spent
joe
jim
turned
him
loose
on
the
largest
collection
of
books
that
hugh
had
ever
seen
some
of
them
were
copies
of
books
hugh
had
seen
before
but
even
these
he
read
with
new
meanings
he
read
incessantly
his
mind
soaking
up
new
ideas
stumbling
over
them
struggling
striving
to
grasp
them
he
begrudged
sleep
he
forgot
to
eat
until
his
breath
grew
sour
and
compelling
pain
in
his
midriff
forced
him
to
pay
attention
to
his
body
hunger
satisfied
he
would
be
back
at
it
until
his
head
ached
and
his
eyes
refused
to
focus
joe
jim
s
demands
for
service
were
few
although
hugh
was
never
off
duty
joe
jim
did
not
mind
his
reading
as
long
as
he
was
within
earshot
and
ready
to
jump
when
called
playing
checkers
with
one
of
the
pair
when
the
other
did
not
care
to
play
was
the
service
which
used
up
the
most
time
and
even
this
was
not
a
total
loss
for
if
the
player
were
joe
he
could
almost
always
be
diverted
into
a
discussion
of
the
ship
its
history
its
machinery
as
equpment
the
sort
of
people
who
had
built
it
and
then
manned
it
and
their
history
back
on
earth
earth
the
incredible
that
strange
place
where
people
had
lived
on
the
outside
instead
of
the
inside
hugh
wondered
why
they
did
not
fall
off
he
took
the
matter
up
with
joe
and
at
last
gained
some
notion
of
gravitation
he
never
really
understood
it
emotionally
it
was
too
wildly
improbable
but
as
an
intellectual
concept
he
was
able
to
accept
it
and
use
it
much
later
in
his
first
vague
glimmerings
of
the
science
of
ballistics
and
the
art
of
astrogation
and
ship
maneuvering
and
it
led
in
time
to
his
wondering
about
weight
in
the
ship
a
matter
that
had
never
bothered
him
before
the
lower
the
level
the
greater
the
weight
had
been
to
his
mind
simply
the
order
of
nature
and
nothing
to
wonder
at
he
was
familiar
with
centrifugal
force
as
it
applied
to
slingshots
to
apply
it
also
to
the
whole
ship
to
think
of
the
ship
as
spinning
like
a
slingshot
and
thereby
causing
weight
was
too
much
of
a
hurdle
he
never
really
believed
it
joe
jim
took
him
back
once
more
to
the
control
room
and
showed
him
what
little
joe
jim
knew
about
the
manipulation
of
the
controls
and
the
reading
of
the
astrogation
instruments
the
long
forgotten
engineer
designers
employed
by
the
jordan
foundation
had
been
instructed
to
design
a
ship
that
would
not
could
not
wear
out
even
though
the
trip
were
protracted
beyond
the
expected
sixty
years
they
builded
better
than
they
knew
in
planning
the
main
drive
engines
and
the
auxiliary
machinery
largely
automatic
which
would
make
the
ship
habitable
and
in
designing
the
controls
necessary
to
handle
all
machinery
not
entirely
automatic
the
very
idea
of
moving
parts
had
been
rejected
the
engines
and
auxiliary
equipment
worked
on
a
level
below
mechanical
motion
on
a
level
of
pure
force
as
electrical
transformers
do
instead
of
push
buttons
levers
cams
and
shafts
the
controls
and
the
machinery
they
served
were
planned
in
terms
of
balance
between
static
fields
bias
of
electronic
flow
circuits
broken
or
closed
by
a
hand
placed
over
a
light
on
this
level
of
action
friction
lost
its
meaning
wear
and
erosion
took
no
toll
had
all
hands
been
killed
in
the
mutiny
the
ship
would
still
have
plunged
on
through
space
still
lighted
its
air
still
fresh
and
moist
its
engines
ready
and
waiting
as
it
was
though
elevators
and
conveyor
belts
fell
into
disrepair
disuse
and
finally
into
the
oblivion
of
forgotten
function
the
essential
machinery
of
the
ship
continued
its
automatic
service
to
its
ignorant
human
freight
or
waited
quiet
and
ready
for
someone
bright
enough
to
puzzle
out
its
key
genius
had
gone
into
the
building
of
the
ship
far
too
huge
to
be
assembled
on
earth
it
had
been
put
together
piece
by
piece
in
its
own
orbit
out
beyond
the
moon
there
it
had
swung
for
fifteen
silent
years
while
the
problems
presented
by
the
decision
to
make
its
machinery
foolproof
and
enduring
had
been
formulated
and
solved
a
whole
new
field
of
submolar
action
had
been
conceived
in
the
process
struggled
with
and
conquered
so
when
hugh
placed
an
untutored
questing
hand
over
the
first
of
a
row
of
lights
marked
acceleration
positive
he
got
an
immediate
response
though
not
in
terms
of
acceleration
a
red
light
at
the
top
of
the
chief
pilot
s
board
blinked
rapidly
and
the
annunciator
panel
glowed
with
a
message
main
engines
not
manned
what
does
that
mean
he
asked
joe
jim
there
s
no
telling
said
jim
we
ve
done
the
same
thing
in
the
main
engine
room
added
joe
there
when
you
try
it
it
says
control
room
not
manned
hugh
thought
a
moment
what
would
happen
he
persisted
if
all
the
control
stations
had
somebody
at
em
at
once
and
then
i
did
that
can
t
say
said
joe
never
been
able
to
try
it
hugh
said
nothing
a
resolve
which
had
been
growing
formless
in
his
mind
was
now
crystalizing
into
decision
he
was
busy
with
it
for
some
time
weighing
it
refining
it
and
looking
for
the
right
moment
to
bring
it
into
the
open
he
waited
until
he
found
joe
jim
in
a
mellow
mood
both
of
him
before
broaching
his
idea
they
were
in
the
captain
s
veranda
at
the
time
hugh
decided
the
moment
was
due
joe
jim
rested
gently
in
the
captain
s
easy
chair
his
belly
full
of
food
and
gazed
out
through
the
heavy
glass
of
the
view
port
at
the
serene
stars
hugh
floated
beside
him
the
spinning
of
the
ship
caused
the
stars
to
cross
the
circle
of
the
port
in
barely
perceptible
arcs
presently
he
said
joe
jim
eh
what
s
that
youngster
it
was
joe
who
had
replied
it
s
pretty
swell
isn
t
it
what
is
all
that
the
stars
hugh
indicated
the
view
through
the
port
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
then
caught
at
the
chair
to
stop
his
own
backspin
yeah
it
sure
is
makes
you
feel
good
surprisingly
it
was
jim
who
offered
this
hugh
knew
the
time
was
right
he
waited
a
moment
then
said
why
don
t
we
finish
the
job
two
heads
turned
simultaneously
joe
leaning
out
a
little
to
see
past
jim
what
job
the
trip
why
don
t
we
start
up
the
main
drive
and
go
on
with
it
somewhere
out
there
be
said
hurriedly
to
finish
before
he
was
interrupted
there
are
planets
like
earth
or
so
the
first
crew
thought
let
s
go
find
them
jim
looked
at
him
then
laughed
joe
shook
his
head
kid
he
said
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
you
re
as
balmy
as
bobo
no
he
went
on
that
s
all
over
and
done
with
forget
it
why
is
it
over
and
done
with
joe
well
because
it
s
too
big
a
job
it
takes
a
crew
that
understands
what
it
s
all
about
trained
to
operate
the
ship
does
it
take
so
many
you
have
shown
me
only
about
a
dozen
places
all
told
for
men
actually
to
be
at
the
controls
couldn
t
a
dozen
men
run
the
ship
if
they
knew
what
you
know
he
added
slyly
jim
chuckled
he
s
got
you
joe
he
s
right
joe
brushed
it
aside
you
overrate
our
knowledge
maybe
we
could
operate
the
ship
but
we
wouldn
t
get
anywhere
we
don
t
know
where
we
are
the
ship
has
been
drifting
for
i
don
t
know
how
many
generations
we
don
t
know
where
we
re
headed
or
how
fast
we
re
going
but
look
hugh
pleaded
there
are
instruments
you
showed
them
to
me
couldn
t
we
learn
how
to
use
them
couldn
t
you
figure
them
out
joe
if
you
really
wanted
to
oh
i
suppose
so
jim
agreed
don
t
boast
jim
said
joe
i
m
not
boasting
snapped
jim
if
a
thing
ll
work
i
can
figure
it
out
humph
said
joe
the
matter
rested
in
delicate
balance
hugh
had
got
them
disagreeing
among
themselves
which
was
what
he
wanted
with
the
less
tractable
of
the
pair
on
his
side
now
to
consolidate
his
gain
i
had
an
idea
he
said
quickly
to
get
you
men
to
work
with
jim
if
you
were
able
to
train
them
what
s
your
idea
demanded
jim
suspiciously
well
you
remember
what
i
told
you
about
a
bunch
of
the
younger
scientists
those
fools
yes
yes
sure
but
they
didn
t
know
what
you
know
in
their
way
they
were
trying
to
be
reasonable
now
if
i
could
go
back
down
and
tell
them
what
you
ve
taught
me
i
could
get
you
enough
men
to
work
with
joe
cut
in
take
a
good
look
at
us
hugh
what
do
you
see
why
why
i
see
you
joe
jim
you
see
a
mutie
corrected
joe
his
voice
edged
with
sarcasm
we
re
a
mutie
get
that
your
scientists
won
t
work
with
us
no
no
protested
hugh
that
s
not
true
i
m
not
talking
about
peasants
peasants
wouldn
t
understand
but
these
are
scientists
and
the
smartest
of
the
lot
they
ll
understand
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
arrange
safe
conduct
for
them
through
mutie
country
you
can
do
that
can
t
you
he
added
instinctively
shifting
the
point
of
the
argument
to
firmer
ground
why
sure
said
jim
forget
it
said
joe
well
o
k
hugh
agreed
sensing
that
joe
really
was
annoyed
at
his
persistence
but
it
would
be
fun
he
withdrew
some
distance
from
the
brothers
he
could
hear
joe
jim
continuing
the
discussion
with
himself
in
low
tones
he
pretended
to
ignore
it
joe
jim
had
this
essential
defect
in
his
joint
nature
being
a
committee
rather
than
a
single
individual
he
was
hardly
fitted
to
be
a
man
of
action
since
all
decisions
were
necessarily
the
result
of
discussion
and
compromise
several
moments
later
hugh
heard
joe
s
voice
raised
all
right
all
right
have
it
your
own
way
he
then
called
out
hugh
come
here
hugh
kicked
himself
away
from
an
adjacent
bulkhead
and
shot
over
to
the
immediate
vicinity
of
joe
jim
arresting
his
flight
with
both
hands
against
the
framework
of
the
captain
s
chair
we
ve
decided
said
joe
without
preliminaries
to
let
you
go
back
down
to
the
high
weight
and
try
to
peddle
your
goods
but
you
re
a
fool
he
added
sourly
bobo
escorted
hugh
down
through
the
dangers
of
the
levels
frequented
by
muties
and
left
him
in
the
uninhabited
zone
above
high
weight
thanks
bobo
hugh
said
in
parting
good
eating
the
dwarf
grinned
ducked
his
head
and
sped
away
swarming
up
the
ladder
they
had
just
descended
hugh
turned
and
started
down
touching
his
knife
as
he
did
so
it
was
good
to
feel
it
against
him
again
not
that
it
was
his
original
knife
that
had
been
bobo
s
prize
when
he
was
captured
and
bobo
had
been
unable
to
return
it
having
inadvertently
left
it
sticking
in
a
big
one
that
got
away
but
the
replacement
joe
jim
had
given
him
was
well
balanced
and
quite
satisfactory
bobo
had
conducted
him
at
hugh
s
request
and
by
joe
jim
s
order
down
to
the
area
directly
over
the
auxiliary
converter
used
by
the
scientists
he
wanted
to
find
bill
ertz
assistant
chief
engineer
and
leader
of
the
bloc
of
younger
scientists
and
he
did
not
want
to
have
to
answer
too
many
questions
before
he
found
him
hugh
dropped
quickly
down
the
remaining
levels
and
found
himself
in
a
main
passageway
which
he
recognized
good
a
turn
to
the
left
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
walk
and
he
found
himself
at
the
door
of
the
compartment
which
housed
the
converter
a
guard
lounged
in
front
of
it
hugh
started
to
push
on
past
was
stopped
where
do
you
think
you
re
going
i
want
to
find
bill
ertz
you
mean
the
chief
engineer
well
he
s
not
here
chief
what
s
happened
to
the
old
one
hoyland
regretted
the
remark
at
once
but
it
was
already
out
huh
the
old
chief
why
he
s
made
the
trip
long
since
the
guard
looked
at
him
suspiciously
what
s
wrong
with
you
nothing
denied
hugh
just
a
slip
funny
sort
of
a
slip
well
you
ll
find
chief
ertz
around
his
office
probably
thanks
good
eating
good
eating
hugh
was
admitted
to
see
ertz
after
a
short
wait
ertz
looked
up
from
his
desk
as
hugh
came
in
well
he
said
so
you
re
back
and
not
dead
after
all
this
is
a
surprise
we
had
written
you
off
you
know
as
making
the
trip
yes
i
suppose
so
well
sit
down
and
tell
me
about
it
i
ve
a
little
time
to
spare
at
the
moment
do
you
know
though
i
wouldn
t
have
recognized
you
you
ve
changed
a
lot
all
that
gray
hair
i
imagine
you
had
some
pretty
tough
times
gray
hair
was
his
hair
gray
and
ertz
had
changed
a
lot
too
hugh
now
noticed
he
was
paunchy
and
the
lines
in
his
face
had
set
good
jordan
how
long
had
he
been
gone
ertz
drummed
on
his
desk
top
and
pursed
his
lips
it
makes
a
problem
your
coming
back
like
this
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
just
assign
you
to
your
old
job
mort
tyler
has
that
but
we
ll
find
a
place
for
you
suitable
to
your
rank
hugh
recalled
mort
tyler
and
not
too
favorably
a
precious
sort
of
a
chap
always
concerned
with
what
was
proper
and
according
to
regulations
so
tyler
had
actually
made
scientisthood
and
was
on
hugh
s
old
job
at
the
converter
well
it
didn
t
matter
that
s
all
right
he
began
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
of
course
there
s
the
matter
of
seniority
ertz
went
on
perhaps
the
council
had
better
consider
the
matter
i
don
t
know
of
a
precedent
we
ve
lost
a
number
of
scientists
to
the
muties
in
the
past
but
you
are
the
first
to
escape
with
his
life
in
my
memory
that
doesn
t
matter
hugh
broke
in
i
ve
something
much
more
pressing
to
talk
about
while
i
was
away
i
found
out
some
amazing
things
bill
things
that
it
is
of
paramount
importance
for
you
to
know
about
that
s
why
i
came
straight
to
you
listen
i
ertz
was
suddenly
alert
of
course
you
have
i
must
be
slowing
down
you
must
have
had
a
marvelous
opportunity
to
study
the
muties
and
scout
out
their
territory
come
on
man
spill
it
give
me
your
report
hugh
wet
his
lips
it
s
not
what
you
think
he
said
it
s
much
more
important
than
just
a
report
on
the
muties
though
it
concerns
them
too
in
fact
we
may
have
to
change
our
whole
policy
with
respect
to
the
mu
well
go
ahead
go
ahead
i
m
listening
all
right
hugh
told
him
of
his
tremendous
discovery
as
to
the
actual
nature
of
the
ship
choosing
his
words
carefully
and
trying
very
hard
to
be
convincing
he
dwelt
lightly
on
the
difficulties
presented
by
an
attempt
to
reorganize
the
ship
in
accordance
with
the
new
concept
and
bore
down
heavily
on
the
prestige
and
honor
that
would
accrue
to
the
man
who
led
the
effort
he
watched
ertz
s
face
as
he
talked
after
the
first
start
of
complete
surprise
when
hugh
launched
his
key
idea
the
fact
that
the
ship
was
actually
a
moving
body
in
a
great
outside
space
his
face
became
impassive
and
hugh
could
read
nothing
in
it
except
that
he
seemed
to
detect
a
keener
interest
when
hugh
spoke
of
how
ertz
was
just
the
man
for
the
job
because
of
his
leadership
of
the
younger
more
progressive
scientists
when
hugh
concluded
he
waited
for
ertz
s
response
ertz
said
nothing
at
first
simply
continued
with
his
annoying
habit
of
drumming
on
the
top
of
his
desk
finally
he
said
these
are
important
matters
hoyland
much
too
important
to
be
dealt
with
casually
i
must
have
time
to
chew
it
over
yes
certainly
hugh
agreed
i
wanted
to
add
that
i
ve
made
arrangements
for
safe
passage
up
to
no
weight
i
can
take
you
up
and
let
you
see
for
yourself
no
doubt
that
is
best
ertz
replied
well
are
you
hungry
no
then
we
ll
both
sleep
on
it
you
can
use
the
compartment
at
the
back
of
my
office
i
don
t
want
you
discussing
this
with
anyone
else
until
i
ve
had
time
to
think
about
it
it
might
cause
unrest
if
it
got
out
without
proper
prepartion
yes
you
re
right
very
well
then
ertz
ushered
him
into
a
compartment
behind
his
office
which
he
very
evidently
used
for
a
lounge
have
a
good
rest
he
said
and
we
ll
talk
later
thanks
hugh
acknowledged
good
eating
good
eating
once
he
was
alone
hugh
s
excitement
gradually
dropped
away
from
him
and
he
realized
that
he
was
fagged
out
and
very
sleepy
he
stretched
out
on
a
builtin
couch
and
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
he
discovered
that
the
only
door
to
the
compartment
was
barred
from
the
other
side
worse
than
that
his
knife
was
gone
he
had
waited
an
indefinitely
long
time
when
he
heard
activity
at
the
door
it
opened
two
husky
unsmiling
men
entered
come
along
said
one
of
them
he
sized
them
up
noting
that
neither
of
them
carried
a
knife
no
chance
to
snatch
one
from
their
belts
then
on
the
other
hand
he
might
be
able
to
break
away
from
them
but
beyond
them
a
wary
distance
away
in
the
outer
room
were
two
other
equally
formidable
men
each
armed
with
a
knife
one
balanced
his
for
throwing
the
other
held
his
by
the
grip
ready
to
stab
at
close
quarters
he
was
boxed
in
and
be
knew
it
they
had
anticipated
his
possible
moves
he
had
long
since
learned
to
relax
before
the
inevitable
he
composed
his
face
and
marched
quietly
out
once
through
the
door
he
saw
ertz
waiting
and
quite
evidently
in
charge
of
the
party
of
men
he
spoke
to
him
being
careful
to
keep
his
voice
calm
hello
bill
pretty
extensive
preparations
you
ve
made
some
trouble
maybe
ertz
seemed
momentarily
uncertain
of
his
answer
then
said
you
re
going
before
the
captain
good
hugh
answered
thanks
bill
but
do
you
think
it
s
wise
to
try
to
sell
the
idea
to
him
without
laying
a
little
preliminary
foundation
with
the
others
ertz
was
annoyed
at
his
apparent
thickheadedness
and
showed
it
you
don
t
get
the
idea
he
growled
you
re
going
before
the
captain
to
stand
trial
for
heresy
hugh
considered
this
as
if
the
idea
had
not
before
occurred
to
him
he
answered
mildly
you
re
off
down
the
wrong
passage
bill
perhaps
a
charge
and
trial
is
the
best
way
to
get
at
the
matter
but
i
m
not
a
peasant
simply
to
be
hustled
before
the
captain
i
must
be
tried
by
the
council
i
am
a
scientist
are
you
now
ertz
said
softly
i
ve
had
advice
about
that
you
were
written
off
the
lists
just
what
you
are
is
a
matter
for
the
captain
to
determine
hugh
held
his
peace
it
was
against
him
he
could
see
and
there
was
no
point
in
antagonizing
ertz
ertz
made
a
signal
the
two
unarmed
men
each
grasped
one
of
hugh
s
arms
he
went
with
them
quietly
hugh
looked
at
the
captain
with
new
interest
the
old
man
had
not
changed
much
a
little
fatter
perhaps
the
captain
settled
himself
slowly
down
in
his
chair
and
picked
up
the
memorandum
before
him
what
s
this
all
about
he
began
irritably
i
don
t
understand
it
mort
tyler
was
there
to
present
the
case
against
hugh
a
circumstance
which
hugh
had
had
no
way
of
anticipating
and
which
added
to
his
misgivings
he
searched
his
boyhood
recollections
for
some
handle
by
which
to
reach
the
man
s
sympathy
found
none
tyler
cleared
his
throat
and
commenced
this
is
the
case
of
one
hugh
hoyland
captain
formerly
one
of
your
junior
scientists
scientist
eh
why
doesn
t
the
council
deal
with
him
because
he
is
no
longer
a
scientist
captain
he
went
over
to
the
muties
he
now
returns
among
us
preaching
heresy
and
seeking
to
undermine
your
authority
the
captain
looked
at
hugh
with
the
ready
belligerency
of
a
man
jealous
of
his
prerogatives
is
that
so
he
bellowed
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
it
is
not
true
captain
hugh
answered
all
that
i
have
said
to
anyone
has
been
an
affirmation
of
the
absolute
truth
of
our
ancient
knowledge
i
have
not
disputed
the
truths
under
which
we
live
i
have
simply
affirmed
them
more
forcibly
than
is
the
ordinary
custom
i
i
still
don
t
understand
this
the
captain
interrupted
shaking
his
head
you
re
charged
with
heresy
yet
you
say
you
believe
the
teachings
if
you
aren
t
guilty
why
are
you
here
perhaps
i
can
clear
the
matter
up
put
in
ertz
hoyland
well
i
hope
you
can
the
captain
went
on
come
let
s
hear
it
ertz
proceeded
to
give
a
reasonably
correct
but
slanted
version
of
hoyland
s
return
and
his
strange
story
the
captain
listened
with
an
expression
that
varied
between
puzzlement
and
annoyance
when
ertz
had
concluded
the
captain
turned
to
hugh
humph
he
said
hugh
spoke
immediately
the
gist
of
my
contention
captain
is
that
there
is
a
place
up
at
no
weight
where
you
can
actually
see
the
truth
of
our
faith
that
the
ship
is
moving
where
you
can
actually
see
jordan
s
plan
in
operation
that
is
not
a
denial
of
faith
that
affirms
it
there
is
no
need
to
take
my
word
for
it
jordan
himself
will
prove
it
seeing
that
the
captain
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
indecision
tyler
broke
in
captain
there
is
a
possible
explanation
of
this
incredible
situation
which
i
feel
duty
bound
that
you
should
hear
offhand
there
are
two
obvious
interpretations
of
hoyland
s
ridiculous
story
he
may
simply
be
guilty
of
extreme
heresy
or
he
may
be
a
mutie
at
heart
and
engaged
in
a
scheme
to
lure
you
into
their
hands
but
there
is
a
third
more
charitable
explanation
and
one
which
i
feel
within
me
is
probably
the
true
one
there
is
record
that
hoyland
was
seriously
considered
for
the
converter
at
his
birth
inspection
but
that
his
deviation
from
normal
was
slight
being
simply
an
overlarge
head
and
he
was
passed
it
seems
to
me
that
the
terrible
experiences
he
has
undergone
at
the
hands
of
the
muties
have
finally
unhinged
an
unstable
mind
the
poor
chap
is
simply
not
responsible
for
his
own
actions
hugh
looked
at
tyler
with
new
respect
to
absolve
him
of
guilt
and
at
the
same
time
to
make
absolutely
certain
that
hugh
would
wind
up
making
the
trip
how
neat
the
captain
shook
a
palm
at
them
this
has
gone
on
long
enough
then
turning
to
ertz
is
there
recommendation
yes
captain
the
converter
very
well
then
i
really
don
t
see
ertz
he
continued
testily
why
i
should
be
bothered
with
these
details
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
be
able
to
handle
discipline
in
your
department
without
my
help
yes
captain
the
captain
shoved
back
from
his
desk
started
to
get
up
recommendation
confirmed
dismissed
anger
flooded
through
hugh
at
the
unreasonable
injustice
of
it
they
had
not
even
considered
looking
at
the
only
real
evidence
he
had
in
his
defense
he
heard
a
shout
wait
then
discovered
it
was
his
own
voice
the
captain
paused
looking
at
him
wait
a
moment
hugh
went
on
his
words
spilling
out
of
their
own
accord
this
won
t
make
any
difference
for
you
re
all
so
damn
sure
you
know
all
the
answers
that
you
won
t
consider
a
fair
offer
to
come
see
with
your
own
eyes
nevertheless
nevertheless
it
still
moves
hugh
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
lying
in
the
compartment
where
they
confined
him
to
await
the
power
needs
of
the
converter
time
to
think
and
to
second
guess
his
mistakes
telling
his
tale
to
ertz
immediately
that
had
been
mistake
number
one
he
should
have
waited
become
reacquainted
with
the
man
and
felt
him
out
instead
of
depending
on
a
friendship
which
had
never
been
very
close
second
mistake
mort
tyler
when
he
heard
his
name
he
should
have
investigated
and
found
out
just
how
much
influence
the
man
had
with
ertz
he
had
known
him
of
old
he
should
have
known
better
well
here
he
was
condemned
as
a
mutant
or
maybe
as
a
heretic
it
came
to
the
same
thing
he
considered
whether
or
not
he
should
have
tried
to
explain
why
mutants
happened
he
had
learned
about
it
himself
in
some
of
the
old
records
in
joe
jim
s
possession
no
it
wouldn
t
wash
how
could
you
explain
about
radiations
from
the
outside
causing
the
birth
of
mutants
when
the
listeners
did
not
believe
there
was
such
a
place
as
outside
no
he
had
messed
it
up
before
he
was
ever
taken
before
the
captain
his
self
recriminations
were
disturbed
at
last
by
the
sound
of
his
door
being
unfastened
it
was
too
soon
for
another
of
the
infrequent
meals
he
thought
that
they
had
come
at
last
to
take
him
away
and
renewed
his
resolve
to
take
someone
with
him
but
he
was
mistaken
he
heard
a
voice
of
gentle
dignity
son
son
how
does
this
happen
it
was
lieutenant
nelson
his
first
teacher
looking
older
than
ever
and
frail
the
interview
was
distressing
for
both
of
them
the
old
man
childless
himself
had
cherished
great
hopes
for
his
proteg
233
even
the
ambition
that
he
might
eventually
aspire
to
the
captaincy
though
he
had
kept
his
vicarious
ambition
to
himself
believing
it
not
good
for
the
young
to
praise
them
too
highly
it
had
hurt
his
heart
when
the
youth
was
lost
now
he
had
returned
a
man
but
under
disgraceful
conditions
and
under
sentence
of
death
the
meeting
was
no
less
unhappy
for
hugh
he
had
loved
the
old
man
in
his
way
wanted
to
please
him
and
needed
his
approval
but
he
could
see
as
he
told
his
story
that
nelson
was
not
capable
of
treating
the
the
story
as
anything
but
an
aberration
of
hugh
s
mind
and
he
suspected
that
nelson
would
rather
see
him
meet
a
quick
death
in
the
converter
his
atoms
smashed
to
hydrogen
and
giving
up
clean
useful
power
than
have
him
live
to
make
a
mock
of
the
ancient
teachings
in
that
he
did
the
old
man
an
injustice
he
underrated
nelson
s
mercy
but
not
his
devotion
to
science
but
let
it
be
said
for
hugh
that
had
there
been
no
more
at
issue
than
his
own
personal
welfare
he
might
have
preferred
death
to
breaking
the
heart
of
his
benefactor
being
a
romantic
and
more
than
a
bit
foolish
presently
the
old
man
got
up
to
leave
the
visit
having
grown
unendurable
to
each
of
them
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
son
do
they
feed
you
well
enough
quite
well
thanks
hugh
lied
is
there
anything
else
no
yes
you
might
send
me
some
tobacco
i
haven
t
had
a
chew
in
a
long
time
i
ll
take
care
of
it
is
there
anyone
you
would
like
to
see
why
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
was
not
permitted
visitors
ordinary
visitors
you
are
right
but
i
think
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
get
the
rule
relaxed
but
you
will
have
to
give
me
your
promise
not
to
speak
of
your
heresy
he
added
anxiously
hugh
thought
quickly
this
was
a
new
aspect
a
new
possibility
his
uncle
no
while
they
had
always
got
along
well
their
minds
did
not
meet
they
would
greet
each
other
as
strangers
he
had
never
made
friends
easily
ertz
had
been
his
obvious
next
friend
and
now
look
at
the
damned
thing
then
he
recalled
his
village
chum
alan
mahoney
with
whom
he
had
played
as
a
boy
true
he
had
seen
practically
nothing
of
him
since
the
time
he
was
apprenticed
to
nelson
still
does
alan
mahoney
still
live
in
our
village
why
yes
i
d
like
to
see
him
if
he
ll
come
alan
arrived
nervous
ill
at
ease
but
plainly
glad
to
see
hugh
and
very
much
upset
to
find
him
under
sentence
to
make
the
trip
hugh
pounded
him
on
the
back
good
boy
he
said
i
knew
you
would
come
of
course
i
would
protested
alan
once
i
knew
but
nobody
in
the
village
knew
it
i
don
t
think
even
the
witnesses
knew
it
well
you
re
here
that
s
what
matters
tell
me
about
yourself
have
you
married
huh
uh
no
let
s
not
waste
time
talking
about
me
nothing
ever
happens
to
me
anyhow
how
in
jordan
s
name
did
you
get
in
this
jam
hugh
i
can
t
talk
about
that
alan
i
promised
lieutenant
nelson
that
i
wouldn
t
well
what
s
a
promise
that
kind
of
a
promise
you
re
in
a
jam
fellow
don
t
i
know
it
somebody
have
it
in
for
you
well
our
old
pal
mort
tyler
didn
t
help
any
i
think
i
can
say
that
much
alan
whistled
and
nodded
his
head
slowly
that
explains
a
lot
how
come
you
know
something
maybe
maybe
not
after
you
went
away
he
married
edris
baxter
so
hmm
m
m
yes
that
clears
up
a
lot
he
remained
silent
for
a
time
presently
alan
spoke
up
look
hugh
you
re
not
going
to
sit
here
and
take
it
are
you
particularly
with
tyler
mixed
in
it
we
gotta
get
you
outa
here
how
i
don
t
know
pull
a
raid
maybe
i
guess
i
could
get
a
few
knives
to
rally
round
and
help
us
all
good
boys
spoiling
for
a
fight
then
when
it
s
over
we
d
all
be
for
the
converter
you
me
and
your
pals
no
it
won
t
wash
but
we
ve
got
to
do
something
we
can
t
just
sit
here
and
wait
for
them
to
burn
you
i
know
that
hugh
studied
alan
s
face
was
it
a
fair
thing
to
ask
he
went
on
reassured
by
what
he
had
seen
listen
you
would
do
anything
you
could
to
get
me
out
of
this
wouldn
t
you
you
know
that
alan
s
tone
showed
hurt
very
well
then
there
is
a
dwarf
named
bobo
i
ll
tell
you
how
to
find
him
alan
climbed
up
and
up
higher
than
he
had
ever
been
since
hugh
had
led
him
as
a
boy
into
foolhardy
peril
he
was
older
now
more
conservative
he
had
no
stomach
for
it
to
the
very
real
danger
of
leaving
the
well
traveled
lower
levels
was
added
his
superstitious
ignorance
but
still
he
climbed
this
should
be
about
the
place
unless
he
had
lost
count
but
he
saw
nothing
of
the
dwarf
bobo
saw
him
first
a
slingshot
load
caught
alan
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
even
as
he
was
shouting
bobo
bobo
backed
into
joe
jim
s
compartment
and
dumped
his
load
at
the
feet
of
the
twins
fresh
meat
he
said
proudly
so
it
is
agreed
jim
indifferently
well
it
s
yours
take
it
away
the
dwarf
dug
a
thumb
into
a
twisted
ear
funny
he
said
he
knows
bobo
s
name
joe
looked
up
from
the
book
he
was
reading
_browning
s
collected
poems_
l
press
new
york
london
luna
city
cr
35
that
s
interesting
hold
on
a
moment
hugh
had
prepared
alan
for
the
shock
of
joe
jim
s
appearance
in
reasonably
short
order
he
collected
his
wits
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
tell
his
tale
joe
jim
listened
to
it
without
much
comment
bobo
with
interest
but
little
comprehension
when
alan
concluded
jim
remarked
well
you
win
joe
he
didn
t
make
it
then
turning
to
alan
he
added
you
can
take
hoyland
s
place
can
you
play
checkers
alan
looked
from
one
head
to
the
other
but
you
don
t
understand
he
said
aren
t
you
going
to
do
anything
about
it
joe
looked
puzzled
us
why
should
we
but
you
ve
got
to
don
t
you
see
he
s
depending
on
you
there
s
nobody
else
he
can
look
to
that
s
why
i
came
don
t
you
see
wait
a
moment
drawled
jim
wait
a
moment
keep
your
belt
on
supposing
we
did
want
to
help
him
which
we
don
t
how
in
jordan
s
ship
could
we
answer
me
that
why
why
alan
stumbled
in
the
face
of
such
stupidity
why
get
up
a
rescue
party
of
course
and
go
down
and
get
him
out
why
should
we
get
ourselves
killed
in
a
fight
to
rescue
your
friend
bobo
pricked
his
ears
fight
he
inquired
eagerly
no
bobo
joe
denied
no
fight
just
talk
oh
said
bobo
and
returned
to
passivity
alan
looked
at
the
dwarf
if
you
d
even
let
bobo
and
me
no
joe
said
shortly
it
s
out
of
the
question
shut
up
about
it
alan
sat
in
a
corner
hugging
his
knees
in
despair
if
only
he
could
get
out
of
there
he
could
still
try
to
stir
up
some
help
down
below
the
dwarf
seemed
to
be
asleep
though
it
was
difficult
to
be
sure
with
him
if
only
joe
jim
would
sleep
too
joe
jim
showed
no
indication
of
sleepiness
joe
tried
to
continue
reading
but
jim
interrupted
him
from
time
to
time
alan
could
not
hear
what
they
were
saying
presently
joe
raised
his
voice
is
that
your
idea
of
fun
he
demanded
well
said
jim
it
beats
checkers
it
does
does
it
suppose
you
get
a
knife
in
your
eye
where
would
i
be
then
you
re
getting
old
joe
no
juice
in
you
any
more
you
re
as
old
as
i
am
yeah
but
i
got
young
ideas
oh
you
make
me
sick
have
it
your
own
way
but
don
t
blame
me
bobo
the
dwarf
sprang
up
at
once
alert
yeah
boss
go
out
and
dig
up
squatty
and
long
arm
and
pig
joe
jim
got
up
went
to
a
locker
and
started
pulling
knives
out
of
their
racks
hugh
heard
the
commotion
in
the
passageway
outside
his
prison
it
could
be
the
guards
coming
to
take
him
to
the
converter
though
they
probably
wouldn
t
be
so
noisy
or
it
could
be
just
some
excitement
unrelated
to
him
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
it
was
the
door
burst
open
and
alan
was
inside
shouting
at
him
and
thrusting
a
brace
of
knives
into
his
hands
he
was
hurried
out
of
the
door
while
stuffing
the
knives
in
his
belt
and
accepting
two
more
outside
he
saw
joe
jim
who
did
not
see
him
at
once
as
he
was
methodically
letting
fly
as
calmly
as
if
he
had
been
engaging
in
target
practice
in
his
own
study
and
bobo
who
ducked
his
head
and
grinned
with
a
mouth
widened
by
a
bleeding
cut
but
continued
the
easy
flow
of
the
motion
whereby
he
loaded
and
let
fly
there
were
three
others
two
of
whom
hugh
recognized
as
belonging
to
joe
jim
s
privately
owned
gang
of
bullies
muties
by
definition
and
birthplace
they
were
not
deformed
the
count
does
not
include
still
forms
on
the
floor
plates
come
on
yelled
alan
there
ll
be
more
in
no
time
he
hurried
down
the
passage
to
the
right
joe
jim
desisted
and
followed
him
hugh
let
one
blade
go
for
luck
at
a
figure
running
away
to
the
left
the
target
was
poor
and
he
had
no
time
to
see
if
he
had
thrown
01000
they
scrambled
along
the
passage
bobo
bringing
up
the
rear
as
if
reluctant
to
leave
the
fun
and
came
to
a
point
where
a
side
passage
crossed
the
main
one
alan
led
them
to
the
right
again
stairs
ahead
he
shouted
they
did
not
reach
them
an
airtight
door
rarely
used
clanged
in
their
faces
ten
yards
short
of
the
stairs
joe
jim
s
bravoes
checked
their
flight
and
they
looked
doubtfully
at
their
master
bobo
broke
his
thickened
nails
trying
to
get
a
purchase
on
the
door
the
sounds
of
pursuit
were
clear
behind
them
boxed
in
said
joe
softly
i
hope
you
like
it
jim
hugh
saw
a
head
appear
around
the
corner
of
the
passage
they
had
quitted
he
threw
overhand
but
the
distance
was
too
great
the
knife
clanged
harmlessly
against
steel
the
head
disappeared
long
arm
kept
his
eye
on
the
spot
his
sling
loaded
and
ready
hugh
grabbed
bobo
s
shoulder
listen
do
you
see
that
light
the
dwarf
blinked
stupidly
hugh
pointed
to
the
intersection
of
the
glowtubes
where
they
crossed
in
the
overhead
directly
above
the
junction
of
the
passages
that
light
can
you
hit
them
where
they
cross
bobo
measured
the
distance
with
his
eye
it
would
be
a
hard
shot
under
any
conditions
at
that
range
here
constricted
as
he
was
by
the
low
passageway
it
called
for
a
fast
flat
trajectory
and
allowance
for
higher
weight
then
he
was
used
to
he
did
not
answer
hugh
felt
the
wind
of
his
swing
but
did
not
see
the
shot
there
was
a
tinkling
crash
the
passage
became
dark
now
yelled
hugh
and
led
them
away
at
a
run
as
they
neared
the
intersection
he
shouted
hold
your
breaths
mind
the
gas
the
radioactive
vapor
poured
lazily
out
from
the
broken
tube
above
and
filled
the
crossing
with
a
greenish
mist
hugh
ran
to
the
right
thankful
for
his
knowledge
as
an
engineer
of
the
lighting
circuits
he
had
picked
the
right
direction
the
passage
ahead
was
black
being
serviced
from
beyond
the
break
he
could
hear
footsteps
around
him
whether
they
were
friend
or
enemy
he
did
not
know
they
burst
into
light
no
one
was
in
sight
but
a
scared
and
harmless
peasant
who
scurried
away
at
an
unlikely
pace
they
took
a
quick
muster
all
were
present
but
bobo
was
making
heavy
going
of
it
joe
looked
at
him
he
sniffed
the
gas
i
think
pound
his
back
pig
did
so
with
a
will
bobo
belched
deeply
was
suddenly
sick
then
grinned
he
ll
do
decided
joe
the
slight
delay
had
enabled
one
at
least
to
catch
up
with
them
he
came
plunging
out
of
the
dark
unaware
of
or
careless
of
the
strength
against
him
alan
knocked
pig
s
arm
down
as
he
raised
it
to
throw
let
me
at
him
he
demanded
he
s
mine
it
was
tyler
man
fight
alan
challenged
thumb
on
his
blade
tyler
s
eyes
darted
from
adversary
to
adversary
and
accepted
the
invitation
to
individual
duel
by
lunging
at
alan
the
quarters
were
too
cramped
for
throwing
they
closed
each
achieving
his
grab
in
parry
fist
to
wrist
alan
was
stockier
probably
stronger
tyler
was
slippery
he
attempted
to
give
alan
a
knee
to
the
crotch
alan
evaded
it
stamped
on
tyler
s
planted
foot
they
went
clown
there
was
a
crunching
crack
a
moment
later
alan
was
wiping
his
knife
against
his
thigh
let
s
get
goin
he
complained
i
m
scared
they
reached
a
stairway
and
raced
up
it
long
arm
and
pig
ahead
to
fan
out
on
each
level
and
cover
their
flanks
and
the
third
of
the
three
choppers
hugh
heard
him
called
squatty
covering
the
rear
the
others
bunched
in
between
hugh
thought
they
had
won
free
when
he
heard
shouts
and
the
clatter
of
a
thrown
knife
just
above
him
he
reached
the
level
above
in
time
to
be
cut
not
deeply
but
jaggedly
by
a
ricocheted
blade
three
men
were
down
long
arm
bad
a
blade
sticking
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
upper
arm
but
it
did
not
seem
to
bother
him
his
slingshot
was
still
spinning
pig
was
scrambling
after
a
thrown
knife
his
own
armament
exhausted
but
there
were
signs
of
his
work
one
man
was
down
on
one
knee
some
twenty
feet
away
he
was
bleeding
from
a
knife
wound
in
the
thigh
as
the
figure
steadied
himself
with
one
hand
against
the
bulkhead
and
reached
towards
an
empty
belt
with
the
other
hugh
recognized
him
bill
ertz
he
had
led
a
party
up
another
way
and
flanked
them
to
his
own
ruin
bobo
crowded
behind
hugh
and
got
his
mighty
arm
free
for
the
cast
hugh
caught
at
it
easy
bobo
he
directed
in
the
stomach
and
easy
the
dwarf
looked
puzzled
but
did
as
he
was
told
ertz
folded
over
at
the
middle
and
slid
to
the
deck
well
placed
said
jim
bring
him
along
bobo
directed
hugh
and
stay
in
the
middle
he
ran
his
eye
over
their
party
now
huddled
at
the
top
of
that
flight
of
stairs
all
right
gang
up
we
go
again
watch
it
long
arm
and
pig
swarmed
up
the
next
flight
the
others
disposing
themselves
as
usual
joe
looked
annoyed
in
some
fashion
a
fashion
by
no
means
clear
at
the
moment
he
had
been
eased
out
as
leader
of
this
gang
his
gang
and
hugh
was
giving
orders
he
reflected
as
there
was
no
time
now
to
make
a
fuss
it
might
get
them
all
killed
jim
did
not
appear
to
mind
in
fact
he
seemed
to
be
enjoying
himself
they
put
ten
more
levels
behind
them
with
no
organized
opposition
hugh
directed
them
not
to
kill
peasants
unnecessarily
the
three
bravoes
obeyed
bobo
was
too
loaded
down
with
ertz
to
constitute
a
problem
in
discipline
hugh
saw
to
it
that
they
put
thirty
odd
more
decks
below
them
and
were
well
into
no
man
s
land
before
he
let
vigilance
relax
at
all
then
he
called
a
halt
and
they
examined
wounds
the
only
deep
ones
were
to
long
arm
s
arm
and
bobo
s
face
joe
jim
examined
them
and
applied
presses
with
which
he
had
outfitted
himself
before
starting
hugh
refused
treatment
for
his
flesh
wound
it
s
stopped
bleeding
he
insisted
and
i
ve
got
a
lot
to
do
you
ve
got
nothing
to
do
but
to
get
up
home
said
joe
and
that
will
be
an
end
to
this
foolishness
not
quite
denied
hugh
you
may
be
going
home
but
alan
and
i
and
bobo
are
going
up
to
no
weight
to
the
captain
s
veranda
nonsense
said
joe
what
for
come
along
if
you
like
and
see
all
right
gang
let
s
go
joe
started
to
speak
stopped
when
jim
kept
still
joe
jim
followed
along
they
floated
gently
through
the
door
of
the
veranda
hugh
alan
bobo
with
his
still
passive
burden
and
joe
jim
that
s
it
said
hugh
to
alan
waving
his
hand
at
the
splendid
stars
that
s
what
i
ve
been
telling
you
about
alan
looked
and
clutched
at
hugh
s
arm
jordan
he
moaned
we
ll
fall
out
he
closed
his
eyes
tightly
hugh
shook
him
it
s
all
right
he
said
it
s
grand
open
your
eyes
joe
jim
touched
hugh
s
arm
what
s
it
all
about
he
demanded
why
did
you
bring
him
up
here
he
pointed
to
ertz
oh
him
well
when
he
wakes
up
i
m
going
to
show
him
the
stars
prove
to
him
that
the
ship
moves
well
what
for
then
i
ll
send
him
back
down
to
convince
some
others
hm
m
m
suppose
he
doesn
t
have
any
better
luck
than
you
had
why
then
hugh
shrugged
his
shoulders
why
then
we
shall
just
have
to
do
it
all
over
i
suppose
till
we
do
convince
them
we
ve
got
to
do
it
you
know
common
sense
joe
the
right
hand
head
of
joe
jim
addressed
his
words
to
hugh
hoyland
all
right
smart
boy
you
ve
convinced
the
chief
engineer
he
gestured
toward
bill
ertz
with
the
blade
of
his
knife
then
resumed
picking
jim
s
teeth
with
it
so
what
where
does
it
get
you
i
ve
explained
that
hugh
hoyland
answered
irritably
we
keep
on
until
every
scientist
in
the
ship
from
the
captain
to
the
greenest
probationer
knows
that
the
ship
moves
and
believes
that
we
can
make
it
move
then
we
ll
finish
the
trip
as
jordan
willed
how
many
knives
can
you
muster
he
added
well
for
the
love
of
jordan
listen
have
you
got
some
fool
idea
that
we
are
going
to
help
you
with
this
crazy
scheme
naturally
you
re
necessary
to
it
then
you
had
better
think
up
another
think
that
s
out
bobo
get
out
the
checkerboard
o
k
boss
the
microcephalic
dwarf
hunched
himself
up
off
the
floor
plates
and
trotted
across
joe
jim
s
apartment
hold
it
bobo
jim
the
left
hand
head
had
spoken
the
dwarf
stopped
dead
his
narrow
forehead
wrinkled
the
fact
that
his
two
headed
master
occasionally
failed
to
agree
as
to
what
bobo
should
do
was
the
only
note
of
insecurity
in
his
tranquil
bloodthirsty
existence
let
s
hear
what
he
has
to
say
jim
continued
there
may
be
some
fun
in
this
fun
the
fun
of
getting
a
knife
in
your
ribs
let
me
point
out
that
they
are
my
ribs
too
i
don
t
agree
to
it
i
didn
t
ask
you
to
agree
i
asked
you
to
listen
leaving
fun
out
of
it
it
may
be
the
only
way
to
keep
a
knife
out
of
our
ribs
what
do
you
mean
joe
demanded
suspiciously
you
heard
what
ertz
had
to
say
jim
flicked
a
thumb
toward
the
prisoner
the
ship
s
officers
are
planning
to
clean
out
the
upper
levels
how
would
you
like
to
go
into
the
converter
joe
you
can
t
play
checkers
after
we
re
broken
down
into
hydrogen
bunk
the
crew
can
t
exterminate
the
muties
they
ve
tried
before
jim
turned
to
etrz
how
about
it
ertz
answered
somewhat
diffidently
being
acutely
aware
of
his
own
changed
status
from
a
senior
ship
s
officer
to
prisoner
of
war
he
felt
befuddled
anyhow
too
much
had
happened
and
too
fast
he
had
been
kidnaped
hauled
up
to
the
captain
s
veranda
and
had
there
gazed
out
at
the
stars
the
stars
his
hard
boiled
rationalism
included
no
such
concept
if
an
earth
astronomer
had
had
it
physically
demonstrated
to
him
that
the
globe
spun
on
its
axis
because
someone
turned
a
crank
the
upset
in
evaluations
could
have
been
no
greater
besides
that
he
was
acutely
aware
that
his
own
continued
existence
hung
in
fine
balance
joe
jim
was
the
first
upper
level
mutie
he
had
ever
met
other
than
in
combat
knife
to
knife
a
word
from
him
to
that
great
ugly
dwarf
sprawled
on
the
deck
he
chose
his
words
i
think
the
crew
would
be
successful
this
time
we
they
have
organized
for
it
unless
there
are
more
of
you
than
we
think
there
are
and
better
organized
i
think
it
could
be
done
you
see
well
uh
i
organized
it
you
yes
a
good
many
of
the
council
don
t
like
the
policy
of
letting
the
muties
alone
maybe
it
s
sound
religious
doctrine
and
maybe
it
isn
t
but
we
lose
a
child
here
and
a
couple
of
pigs
there
it
s
annoying
what
do
you
expect
muties
to
eat
demanded
jim
belligerently
thin
air
no
not
exactly
anyhow
the
new
policy
was
not
entirely
destructive
any
muties
that
surrendered
and
could
be
civilized
we
planned
to
give
to
masters
and
put
them
to
work
as
part
of
the
crew
that
is
any
that
weren
t
uh
that
were
he
broke
off
in
embarrassment
and
shifted
his
eyes
from
the
two
headed
monstrosity
before
him
you
mean
any
that
weren
t
physical
mutations
like
me
joe
filled
in
nastily
don
t
you
he
persisted
for
the
likes
of
me
it
s
the
converter
isn
t
it
he
slapped
the
blade
of
his
knife
nervously
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
ertz
edged
away
his
own
hand
shifting
to
his
belt
but
no
knife
was
slung
there
he
felt
naked
and
helpless
without
it
just
a
minute
he
said
defensively
you
asked
me
that
s
the
situation
it
s
out
of
my
hands
i
m
just
telling
you
let
him
alone
joe
he
s
just
handing
you
the
straight
dope
it
s
like
i
was
telling
you
either
go
along
with
hugh
s
plan
or
wait
to
be
hunted
down
and
don
t
get
any
ideas
about
killing
him
we
re
going
to
need
him
as
jim
spoke
he
attempted
to
return
the
knife
to
its
sheath
there
was
a
brief
and
silent
struggle
between
the
twins
for
control
of
the
motor
nerves
to
their
right
arm
a
clash
of
will
below
the
level
of
physical
activity
joe
gave
in
all
right
he
agreed
surlily
but
if
i
go
to
the
converter
i
want
to
take
this
one
with
me
for
company
stow
it
said
jim
you
ll
have
me
for
company
why
do
you
believe
him
he
has
nothing
to
gain
by
lying
ask
alan
alan
mahoney
hugh
s
friend
and
boyhood
chum
had
listened
to
the
argument
round
eyed
without
joining
it
he
too
had
suffered
the
nerve
shaking
experience
of
viewing
the
outer
stars
but
his
ignorant
peasant
mind
had
not
the
sharply
formulated
opinions
of
ertz
the
chief
engineer
ertz
had
been
able
to
see
almost
at
once
that
the
very
existence
of
a
world
outside
the
ship
changed
all
his
plans
and
everything
he
had
believed
in
alan
was
capable
only
of
wonder
what
about
this
plan
to
fight
the
muties
alan
huh
why
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
shucks
i
m
not
a
scientist
say
wait
a
minute
there
was
a
junior
officer
sent
in
to
help
our
village
scientist
lieutenant
nelson
he
stopped
and
looked
puzzled
what
about
it
go
ahead
well
he
has
been
organizing
the
cadets
in
our
village
and
the
married
men
too
but
not
so
much
making
em
practice
with
their
blades
and
slings
never
told
us
what
for
though
ertz
spread
his
hands
you
see
joe
nodded
i
see
he
admitted
grimly
hugh
hoyland
looked
at
him
eagerly
then
you
re
with
me
i
suppose
so
joe
admitted
right
added
jim
hoyland
looked
back
to
ertz
how
about
you
bill
ertz
what
choice
have
i
got
plenty
i
want
you
with
me
wholeheartedly
here
s
the
layout
the
crew
doesn
t
count
it
s
the
officers
we
have
to
convince
any
that
aren
t
too
addlepated
and
stiff
necked
to
understand
after
they
ve
seen
the
stars
and
the
control
room
we
keep
the
others
he
drew
a
thumb
across
his
throat
while
making
a
harsh
sibilance
in
his
cheek
the
converter
bobo
grinned
happily
and
imitated
the
gesture
and
the
sound
ertz
nodded
then
what
muties
and
crew
together
under
a
new
captain
we
move
the
ship
to
far
centaurus
jordan
s
will
be
done
ertz
stood
up
and
faced
hoyland
it
was
a
heady
notion
too
big
to
be
grasped
at
once
but
by
jordan
he
liked
it
he
spread
his
hands
on
the
table
and
leaned
across
it
i
m
with
you
hugh
hoyland
a
knife
clattered
on
the
table
before
him
one
from
the
brace
at
joe
jim
s
belt
joe
looked
startled
seemed
about
to
speak
to
his
brother
then
appeared
to
think
better
of
it
ertz
looked
his
thanks
and
stuck
the
knife
in
his
belt
the
twins
whispered
to
each
other
for
a
moment
then
joe
spoke
up
might
as
well
make
it
stick
he
said
he
drew
his
remaining
knife
and
grasping
the
blade
between
thumb
and
forefinger
so
that
only
the
point
was
exposed
he
jabbed
himself
in
the
fleshly
upper
part
of
his
left
arm
blade
for
blade
ertz
s
eyebrows
shot
up
he
whipped
out
his
newly
acquired
blade
and
cut
himself
in
the
same
location
the
blood
spurted
and
ran
down
to
the
crook
of
his
arm
back
to
back
he
shoved
the
table
aside
and
pressed
his
gory
shoulder
against
the
wound
on
joe
jim
alan
mahoney
hugh
hoyland
bobo
all
had
their
blades
out
all
nicked
their
arms
till
the
skin
ran
red
and
wet
they
crowded
in
bleeding
shoulders
pushed
together
so
that
the
blood
dripped
united
to
the
death
blade
for
blade
back
to
back
blood
to
blood
blood
brothers
to
the
end
of
the
trip
an
apostate
scientist
a
kidnaped
scientist
a
dull
peasant
a
two
headed
monster
a
apple
brained
moron
five
knives
counting
joe
jim
as
one
five
brains
counting
joe
jim
as
two
and
bobo
as
none
five
brains
and
five
knives
to
overthrow
an
entire
culture
but
i
don
t
want
to
go
back
hugh
alan
shuffled
his
feet
and
looked
dogged
why
can
t
i
stay
here
with
you
i
m
a
good
blade
sure
you
are
old
fellow
but
right
now
you
ll
be
more
useful
as
a
spy
but
you
ve
got
bill
ertz
for
that
so
we
have
but
we
need
you
too
bill
is
a
public
figure
he
can
t
duck
out
and
climb
to
the
upper
levels
without
it
being
noticed
and
causing
talk
that
s
where
you
come
in
you
re
his
go
between
i
ll
have
a
huff
of
a
time
explaining
where
i
ve
been
don
t
explain
any
more
than
you
have
to
but
stay
away
from
the
witness
hugh
had
a
sudden
picture
of
alan
trying
to
deceive
the
old
village
historian
with
his
searching
tongue
and
lust
for
details
keep
clear
of
the
witness
the
old
boy
would
trip
you
up
him
you
mean
the
old
one
he
s
dead
made
the
trip
long
since
the
new
one
don
t
amount
to
nothing
good
if
you
re
careful
you
ll
be
safe
hugh
raised
his
voice
bill
are
you
ready
to
go
down
i
suppose
so
ertz
picked
himself
up
and
reluctantly
put
aside
the
book
he
had
been
reading
_the
three
musketeers_
illustrated
one
of
joe
jim
s
carefully
stolen
library
say
that
s
a
wonderful
book
hugh
is
earth
really
like
that
of
course
doesn
t
it
say
so
in
the
book
ertz
chewed
his
lip
and
thought
about
it
what
is
a
house
a
house
a
house
is
a
sort
of
a
a
sort
of
a
compartment
that
s
what
i
thought
at
first
but
how
can
you
ride
on
a
compartment
huh
what
do
you
mean
why
all
through
the
book
they
keep
climbing
on
their
houses
and
riding
away
let
me
see
that
book
joe
ordered
ertz
handed
it
to
him
joe
jim
thumbed
through
it
rapidly
i
see
what
you
mean
idiot
they
ride
horses
not
houses
well
what
s
a
horse
a
horse
is
an
animal
like
a
big
hog
or
maybe
like
a
cow
you
squat
up
on
top
of
it
and
let
it
carry
you
along
ertz
considered
this
it
doesn
t
seem
practical
look
when
you
ride
in
a
litter
you
tell
the
chief
porter
where
you
want
to
go
how
can
you
tell
a
cow
where
you
want
to
go
that
s
easy
you
have
a
porter
lead
it
ertz
conceded
the
point
anyhow
you
might
fall
off
it
isn
t
practical
i
d
rather
walk
it
s
quite
a
trick
joe
explained
takes
practice
can
you
do
it
jim
sniggered
joe
looked
annoyed
there
are
no
horses
in
the
ship
ok
o
k
but
look
these
guys
athos
porthos
and
aramis
they
had
something
we
can
discuss
that
later
hugh
interrupted
bobo
is
back
are
you
ready
to
go
bill
don
t
get
in
a
hurry
hugh
this
is
important
these
chaps
had
knives
sure
why
not
but
they
were
better
than
our
knives
they
had
knives
as
long
as
your
arm
maybe
longer
if
we
are
going
to
fight
the
whole
crew
think
what
an
advantage
that
would
be
hm
m
m
hugh
drew
his
knife
and
looked
at
it
cradling
it
in
his
palm
maybe
you
couldn
t
throw
it
as
well
we
could
have
throwing
knives
too
yes
i
suppose
we
could
the
twins
had
listened
without
comment
he
s
right
put
in
joe
hugh
you
take
care
of
placing
the
knives
jim
and
i
have
some
reading
to
do
both
of
joe
jim
s
heads
were
busy
thinking
of
other
books
they
owned
books
that
discussed
in
saguinary
detail
the
infinitely
varied
methods
used
by
mankind
to
shorten
the
lives
of
enemies
he
was
about
to
institute
a
war
college
department
of
historical
research
although
he
called
his
project
by
no
such
fancy
term
o
k
hugh
agreed
but
you
will
have
to
say
the
word
to
them
right
away
joe
jim
stepped
out
of
his
apartment
into
the
passageway
where
bobo
had
assembled
a
couple
of
dozen
of
joe
jim
s
henchmen
among
the
muties
save
for
long
arm
pig
and
squatty
who
had
taken
part
in
the
rescue
of
hugh
they
were
all
strangers
to
hugh
alan
and
bill
and
they
were
all
sudden
death
to
strangers
joe
jim
motioned
for
the
three
from
the
lower
decks
to
join
him
he
pointed
them
out
to
the
muties
and
ordered
them
to
look
closely
and
not
to
forget
these
three
were
to
have
safe
passage
and
protection
wherever
they
went
furthermore
in
joe
jim
s
absence
his
men
were
to
take
orders
from
any
of
them
they
stirred
and
looked
at
each
other
orders
they
were
used
to
but
from
joe
jim
only
a
big
nosed
individual
rose
up
from
his
squat
and
addressed
them
he
looked
at
joe
jim
but
his
words
were
intended
for
all
i
am
jack
of
the
nose
my
blade
is
sharp
and
my
eye
is
keen
joe
jim
with
the
two
wise
heads
is
my
boss
and
my
knife
fights
for
him
but
joe
is
my
boss
not
strangers
from
heavy
decks
what
do
say
knives
is
that
not
the
rule
he
paused
the
others
had
listened
to
him
stealing
glances
at
joe
jim
joe
muttered
something
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
to
bobo
jack
o
nose
opened
his
mouth
to
continue
there
was
a
smash
of
splintering
teeth
a
crack
from
a
broken
neck
his
mouth
stopped
with
a
missile
bobo
reloaded
his
slingshot
the
body
not
yet
still
settled
slowly
to
the
deck
joe
jim
waved
a
hand
it
good
eating
joe
announced
he
s
yours
the
muties
converged
on
the
body
as
if
they
had
suddenly
been
unleashed
they
concealed
it
completely
in
a
busy
grunting
pile
up
knives
out
they
cuffed
and
crowded
each
other
for
a
piece
of
the
prize
joe
jim
waited
patiently
for
the
undoing
to
be
over
then
when
the
place
where
jack
o
nose
had
been
was
no
more
than
a
stain
on
the
deck
and
the
several
polite
arguments
over
the
sharing
had
died
down
he
started
again
joe
spoke
long
arm
you
and
forty
one
and
the
ax
go
down
with
bobo
alan
and
bill
the
rest
here
bobo
trotted
away
in
the
long
loping
strides
sped
on
by
the
low
pseudogravity
near
the
axis
of
rotation
of
ship
three
of
the
muties
detached
themselves
from
pack
and
followed
ertz
and
alan
mahoney
hurried
catch
up
when
he
reached
the
nearest
staircase
trunk
he
skipped
out
into
space
without
breaking
his
stride
letting
centrifugal
force
carry
him
down
to
the
next
alan
and
the
muties
followed
but
ertz
paused
on
the
edge
and
looked
back
jordan
keep
you
brother
he
sang
out
joe
jim
waved
to
him
and
you
acknowledged
joe
good
eating
jim
added
good
eating
bobo
led
them
down
forty
odd
decks
well
into
no
man
s
land
inhabited
neither
by
mutie
nor
crew
stopped
he
pointed
in
succession
to
long
arm
forty
one
and
the
ax
two
wise
heads
say
for
you
to
watch
here
you
first
he
added
pointing
again
to
forty
one
it
s
like
this
ertz
amplified
alan
and
i
are
going
down
to
heavy
weight
level
you
three
are
to
keep
a
guard
here
one
at
a
time
so
that
i
will
be
able
to
send
messages
back
up
to
joe
jim
get
it
sure
why
not
long
arm
answered
joe
jim
says
it
forty
one
commented
with
a
note
of
finality
in
his
voice
the
ax
grunted
agreeably
o
k
said
bobo
forty
one
sat
down
at
the
stairwell
letting
his
feet
hang
over
and
turned
his
attention
to
food
which
he
had
been
carrying
tucked
under
his
left
arm
bobo
slapped
ertz
and
alan
on
their
backs
good
eating
he
bade
them
grinning
when
he
could
get
his
breath
ertz
acknowledged
the
courteous
thought
then
dropped
at
once
to
the
next
lower
deck
alan
close
after
him
they
had
still
many
decks
to
go
to
civilization
commander
phineas
narby
executive
assistant
to
jordan
s
captain
in
rummaging
through
the
desk
of
the
chief
engineer
was
amused
to
find
that
bill
ertz
had
secreted
therein
a
couple
of
unnecessary
books
there
were
the
usual
sacred
books
of
course
including
the
priceless
_care
and
maintenance
of
the
auxiliary
fourstage
converter_
and
the
_handbook
of
power
light
and
conditioning
starship
vanguard_
these
were
sacred
books
of
the
first
order
bearing
the
imprint
of
jordan
himself
and
could
lawfully
be
held
only
by
the
chief
engineer
narby
considered
himself
a
skeptic
and
rationalist
belief
in
jordan
was
a
good
thing
for
the
crew
nevertheless
the
sight
of
a
title
page
with
the
words
jordan
foundation
on
it
stirred
up
within
him
a
trace
of
religious
awe
such
as
he
had
not
felt
since
before
he
was
admitted
to
scientisthood
he
knew
that
the
feeling
was
irrational
probably
there
had
been
at
some
time
in
the
past
some
person
or
persons
called
jordan
jordan
might
have
been
an
early
engineer
or
captain
who
codified
the
common
sense
and
almost
instinctive
rules
for
running
the
ship
or
as
seemed
more
likely
the
jordan
myth
went
back
much
farther
than
this
book
in
his
hand
and
its
author
had
simply
availed
himself
of
the
ignorant
superstitions
of
the
crew
to
give
his
writings
authority
narby
knew
how
such
things
were
done
he
planned
to
give
the
new
policy
with
respect
to
the
muties
the
same
blessing
of
jordan
when
the
time
was
ripe
for
it
to
be
put
into
execution
yes
order
and
discipline
and
belief
in
authority
were
good
things
for
the
crew
it
was
equally
evident
that
a
rational
coolheaded
common
sense
was
a
proper
attribute
for
the
scientists
who
were
custodians
of
the
ship
s
welfare
common
sense
and
a
belief
in
nothing
but
facts
he
admired
the
exact
lettering
on
the
pages
of
the
book
he
held
they
certainly
had
excellent
clerks
in
those
ancient
times
not
the
sloppy
draftsmen
he
was
forced
to
put
up
with
who
could
hardly
print
two
letters
alike
he
made
a
mental
note
to
study
these
two
indispensable
handbooks
of
the
engineering
department
before
turning
them
over
to
ertz
s
successor
it
would
be
well
he
thought
not
to
be
too
dependent
on
the
statements
of
the
chief
engineer
when
he
himself
succeeded
to
the
captaincy
narby
had
no
particular
respect
for
engineers
largely
because
he
had
no
particular
talent
for
engineering
when
he
had
first
reached
scientisthood
and
had
been
charged
to
defend
the
spiritual
and
material
welfare
of
the
crew
had
sworn
to
uphold
the
teachings
of
jordan
he
soon
discovered
that
administration
and
personnel
management
were
more
in
his
lines
than
tending
the
converter
or
servicing
the
power
lines
he
had
served
as
clerk
village
administrator
recorder
to
the
council
personnel
officer
and
was
now
chief
executive
for
jordan
s
captain
himself
ever
since
an
unfortunate
and
rather
mysterious
accident
had
shortened
the
life
of
narby
s
predecessor
in
that
post
his
decision
to
study
up
on
engineering
before
a
new
chief
engineer
was
selected
brought
to
mind
the
problem
of
choosing
a
new
chief
normally
the
senior
watch
officer
for
the
converter
would
become
chief
engineer
when
a
chief
made
the
trip
but
in
this
case
mort
tyler
the
senior
watch
had
made
the
trip
at
the
same
time
his
body
had
been
found
stiff
and
cold
after
the
mutie
raid
which
had
rescued
that
heretic
hugh
hoyland
that
left
the
choice
wide
open
and
narby
was
a
bit
undecided
as
to
whom
he
should
suggest
to
the
captain
one
thing
was
certain
the
new
chief
must
not
be
a
man
with
as
much
aggressive
initiative
as
ertz
narby
admitted
that
ertz
had
done
a
good
job
in
organizing
the
crew
for
the
proposed
extermination
of
the
muties
but
his
very
efficiency
had
made
him
too
strong
a
candidate
for
succession
to
the
captaincy
if
and
when
had
he
thought
about
it
overtly
narby
might
have
admitted
to
himself
that
the
present
captain
s
life
span
had
extended
unduly
because
narby
was
not
absolutely
certain
that
ertz
would
not
be
selected
what
he
did
think
was
that
this
might
be
a
good
time
for
the
old
captain
to
surrender
his
spirit
to
jordan
the
fat
old
fool
had
long
outlived
his
usefulness
narby
was
tired
of
having
to
wheedle
him
into
giving
the
proper
orders
if
the
council
were
faced
with
the
necessity
of
selecting
a
new
captain
at
this
time
there
was
but
one
candidate
available
narby
put
the
book
down
his
mind
made
up
the
simple
decision
to
eliminate
the
old
captain
carried
with
it
in
narby
s
mind
no
feeling
of
shame
nor
sin
nor
disloyalty
he
felt
contempt
but
not
dislike
for
the
captain
and
no
mean
spirit
colored
his
decision
to
kill
him
narby
s
plans
were
made
on
the
noble
level
of
statesmanship
he
honestly
believed
that
his
objective
was
the
welfare
of
the
entire
crew
common
sense
administration
order
and
discipline
good
eating
for
everyone
he
selected
himself
because
it
was
obvious
to
him
that
he
was
best
fitted
to
accomplish
those
worthy
ends
that
some
must
make
the
trip
in
order
that
these
larger
interests
be
served
he
did
not
find
even
mildly
regrettable
but
he
bore
them
no
malice
what
in
the
huff
are
you
doing
at
my
desk
narby
looked
up
to
see
the
late
bill
ertz
standing
over
him
not
looking
pleased
he
looked
again
then
as
an
afterthought
closed
his
mouth
he
had
been
so
certain
when
ertz
failed
to
reappear
after
the
raid
that
he
had
made
the
trip
and
was
in
all
probability
butchered
and
eaten
so
certain
that
it
was
now
a
sharp
wrench
to
his
mind
to
see
ertz
standing
before
him
aggressively
alive
but
he
pulled
himself
together
bill
jordan
bless
you
man
we
thought
you
had
made
the
trip
sit
down
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
happened
to
you
i
will
if
you
will
get
out
of
my
chair
ertz
answered
bitingly
oh
sorry
narby
hastily
vacated
the
chair
at
ertz
s
desk
and
found
another
and
now
ertz
continued
taking
the
seat
narby
had
left
you
might
explain
why
you
were
going
through
my
writings
narby
managed
to
look
hurt
isn
t
that
obvious
we
assumed
you
were
dead
someone
had
to
take
over
and
attend
to
your
department
until
a
new
chief
was
designated
i
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
captain
ertz
looked
him
in
the
eyes
don
t
give
me
that
guff
narby
you
know
and
i
know
who
puts
words
in
the
captain
s
mouth
we
ve
planned
it
often
enough
even
if
you
did
think
i
was
dead
it
seems
to
me
you
could
wait
longer
than
the
time
between
two
sleeps
to
pry
through
my
desk
now
really
old
man
when
a
person
is
missing
after
a
mutie
raid
it
s
a
common
sense
assumption
that
he
has
made
the
trip
o
k
o
k
skip
it
why
didn
t
mort
tyler
take
over
in
the
meantime
he
s
in
the
converter
killed
eh
but
who
ordered
him
put
in
the
converter
that
much
mass
will
make
a
terrific
peak
in
the
load
i
did
in
place
of
hugh
hoyland
their
masses
were
nearly
the
same
and
your
requisition
for
the
mass
of
hugh
hoyland
was
unfilled
nearly
the
same
isn
t
good
enough
in
handling
the
converter
i
ll
have
to
check
on
it
he
started
to
rise
don
t
get
excited
said
narby
i
m
not
an
utter
fool
in
engineering
you
know
i
ordered
his
mass
to
be
trimmed
according
to
the
same
schedule
you
had
laid
out
for
hoyland
well
all
right
that
will
do
for
now
but
i
will
have
to
check
it
we
can
t
afford
to
waste
mass
speaking
of
waste
mass
narby
said
sweetly
i
found
a
couple
of
unnecessary
books
in
your
desk
well
they
are
classed
as
mass
available
for
power
you
know
so
and
who
is
the
custodian
of
mass
allocated
for
power
you
are
certainly
but
what
were
they
doing
in
your
desk
let
me
point
out
to
you
my
dear
captain
s
best
boy
that
it
lies
entirely
within
my
discretion
where
i
choose
to
store
mass
available
for
power
hm
m
m
i
suppose
you
are
right
by
the
way
if
you
don
t
need
them
for
the
power
schedule
at
once
would
you
mind
letting
me
read
them
not
at
all
if
you
want
to
be
reasonable
about
it
i
ll
check
them
out
to
you
have
to
do
that
they
ve
already
been
centrifuged
just
be
discreet
about
it
thanks
some
of
those
ancients
had
vivid
imaginations
utterly
crazy
of
course
but
amusing
for
relaxation
ertz
got
out
the
two
volumes
and
prepared
a
receipt
for
narby
to
sign
he
did
this
absent
mindedly
being
preoccupied
with
the
problem
of
how
and
when
to
tackle
narby
phineas
narby
he
knew
to
be
a
key
man
in
the
task
he
and
his
blood
brothers
had
undertaken
perhaps
the
key
man
if
he
could
be
won
over
fine
he
said
when
narby
had
signed
i
wonder
if
we
followed
the
wisest
policy
in
hoyland
s
case
narby
looked
surprised
but
said
nothing
oh
i
don
t
mean
that
i
put
any
stock
in
his
story
ertz
added
hastily
but
i
feel
that
we
missed
an
opportunity
we
should
have
kidded
him
along
he
was
a
contact
with
the
muties
the
worst
handicap
we
work
under
in
trying
to
bring
mutie
country
under
the
rule
of
the
council
is
the
fact
that
we
know
very
little
about
theni
we
don
t
know
how
many
of
them
there
are
nor
how
strong
they
are
or
how
well
organized
besides
that
we
will
have
to
carry
the
fight
to
them
and
that
s
a
big
disadvantage
we
don
t
really
know
our
way
around
the
upper
decks
if
we
had
played
along
with
him
and
pretended
to
believe
his
story
we
might
have
learned
a
lot
of
things
but
we
couldn
t
rely
on
what
he
told
us
narby
pointed
out
we
didn
t
need
to
he
offered
us
an
opportunity
to
go
all
the
way
to
no
weight
and
look
around
narby
looked
astounded
you
surely
aren
t
serious
a
member
of
the
crew
that
trusted
the
muties
promise
not
to
harm
him
wouldn
t
get
up
to
no
weight
he
d
make
the
trip
fast
i
m
not
so
certain
about
that
ertz
objected
hoyland
believed
his
own
story
i
m
sure
of
that
and
what
all
that
utter
nonsense
about
the
ship
being
capable
of
moving
the
solid
ship
he
pounded
the
bulkhead
no
one
could
believe
that
but
i
tell
you
he
did
he
s
a
religious
fanatic
granted
but
he
saw
something
up
there
and
that
was
how
he
interpreted
it
we
could
have
gone
up
to
see
whatever
it
was
he
was
raving
about
and
used
the
chance
to
scout
out
the
muties
utterly
foolhardy
i
don
t
think
so
he
must
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
among
the
muties
look
at
the
trouble
they
went
to
just
to
rescue
him
if
he
says
he
can
give
us
safe
passage
up
to
no
weight
i
think
he
can
why
this
sudden
change
of
opinion
it
was
the
raid
that
changed
my
mind
if
anyone
had
told
me
that
a
gang
of
muties
would
come
clear
down
to
high
weight
and
risk
their
necks
to
save
the
life
of
one
man
i
would
not
have
believed
him
but
it
happened
i
m
forced
to
revise
my
opinions
quite
aside
from
his
story
it
s
evident
that
the
muties
will
fight
for
him
and
probably
take
orders
from
him
if
that
is
true
it
would
be
worth
while
to
pander
to
his
religious
convictions
if
it
would
enable
us
to
gain
control
over
the
muties
without
having
to
fight
for
it
narby
shrugged
it
off
theoretically
you
may
have
something
there
but
why
waste
time
over
might
have
beens
if
there
was
such
an
opportunity
we
missed
it
maybe
not
hoyland
is
still
alive
and
back
with
the
muties
if
i
could
figure
out
some
way
of
getting
a
message
to
him
we
might
still
be
able
to
arrange
it
but
how
could
you
i
don
t
know
exactly
i
might
take
a
couple
of
the
boys
and
do
some
climbing
if
we
could
capture
a
mutie
without
killing
him
it
might
work
out
a
slim
chance
i
m
willing
to
risk
it
narby
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
the
whole
plan
seemed
to
him
to
be
filled
with
long
chances
and
foolish
assumptions
nevertheless
if
ertz
were
willing
to
take
the
risk
and
it
did
work
narby
s
dearest
ambition
would
be
much
nearer
realization
subduing
the
unities
by
force
would
be
a
long
and
bloody
job
perhaps
an
impossible
job
he
was
clearly
aware
of
its
difficulty
if
it
did
not
work
nothing
was
lost
but
ertz
now
that
he
thought
it
over
ertz
would
be
no
loss
at
this
point
in
the
game
hm
m
m
go
ahead
he
said
you
are
a
brave
man
but
its
a
worth
while
venture
o
k
ertz
agreed
good
eating
narby
took
the
hint
good
eating
he
answered
gathered
up
the
books
and
left
it
did
not
occur
to
him
until
later
that
ertz
had
not
told
him
where
he
had
been
for
so
long
and
ertz
was
aware
that
narby
had
not
been
entirely
frank
with
him
but
knowing
narby
he
was
not
surprised
he
was
pleased
enough
that
his
extemporaneous
groundwork
for
future
action
had
been
so
well
received
it
never
did
occur
to
him
that
it
might
have
been
simpler
and
more
effective
to
tell
the
truth
ertz
busied
himseif
for
a
short
time
in
making
a
routine
inspection
of
the
converter
and
appointed
an
acting
senior
watch
officer
satisfied
that
his
department
could
then
take
care
of
itself
during
a
further
absence
he
sent
for
his
chief
porter
and
told
the
servant
to
fetch
alan
mahoney
from
his
village
he
had
considered
ordering
his
litter
and
meeting
mahoney
halfway
but
he
decided
against
it
as
being
too
conspicuous
alan
greeted
him
with
enthusiasm
to
him
still
an
unmarried
cadet
and
working
for
more
provident
men
when
his
contemporaries
were
all
heads
of
families
and
solid
men
of
property
the
knowledge
that
he
was
blood
brother
to
a
senior
scientist
was
quite
the
most
important
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
even
overshadowing
his
recent
adventures
the
meaning
of
which
he
was
hardly
qualified
to
understand
anyway
ertz
cut
him
short
and
hastily
closed
the
door
to
the
outer
engineering
office
walls
have
ears
he
said
quietly
and
certainly
clerks
have
ears
and
tongues
as
well
do
you
want
us
both
to
make
the
trip
aw
gosh
bill
i
didn
t
mean
to
never
mind
i
ll
meet
you
on
the
same
stair
trunk
we
came
down
by
ten
decks
above
this
one
can
you
count
sure
i
can
count
that
much
i
can
count
twice
that
much
one
and
one
makes
two
and
one
more
makes
three
and
one
more
makes
four
and
one
makes
five
and
that
s
enough
i
see
you
can
but
i
m
relying
more
on
your
loyalty
and
your
knife
than
i
am
on
your
mathematical
ability
meet
me
there
as
soon
as
you
can
go
up
somewhere
where
you
won
t
be
noticed
forty
one
was
still
on
watch
when
they
reached
the
rendezvous
ertz
called
him
by
name
while
standing
out
of
range
of
slingshot
or
thrown
knife
a
reasonable
precaution
in
dealing
with
a
creature
who
had
grown
to
man
size
by
being
fast
with
his
weapons
once
identification
had
been
established
he
directed
the
guard
to
find
hugh
hoyland
he
and
alan
sat
down
to
wait
forty
one
failed
to
find
hugh
hoyland
at
joe
jim
s
apartment
nor
was
joe
jim
there
he
did
find
bobo
but
the
pinhead
was
not
very
helpful
hugh
bobo
told
him
had
gone
up
where
everybody
flies
that
meant
very
little
to
forty
one
he
had
been
up
to
no
weight
only
once
in
his
life
since
the
level
of
weightlessness
extended
the
entire
length
of
the
ship
being
in
fact
the
last
concentric
cylinder
around
the
ship
s
axis
not
that
forty
one
could
conceive
it
in
those
terms
the
information
that
hugh
had
headed
for
no
weight
was
not
helpful
forty
one
was
puzzled
an
order
from
joe
jim
was
not
to
be
ignored
and
he
had
got
it
through
his
not
overbright
mind
that
an
order
from
ertz
carried
the
same
weight
he
woke
bobo
up
again
where
is
the
two
wise
heads
gone
to
see
knifemaker
bobo
closed
his
eyes
again
that
was
better
forty
one
knew
where
the
knifemaker
lived
every
mutie
had
dealings
with
her
she
was
the
indispensable
artisan
and
tradesman
of
mutie
country
her
person
was
necessarily
taboo
her
workshop
and
the
adjacent
neighborhood
were
neutral
territory
for
all
he
scurried
up
two
decks
and
hurried
thence
a
door
reading
thermodynamic
laboratory
keep
out
was
standing
open
forty
one
could
not
read
neither
the
name
nor
the
injunction
mattered
to
him
but
he
could
hear
voices
one
of
which
be
identified
as
coming
from
the
twins
the
other
from
the
knifemaker
he
walked
in
boss
be
began
shut
up
said
joe
jim
did
not
look
around
but
continued
his
argument
with
the
mother
of
blades
you
ll
make
knives
he
said
and
none
of
your
lip
she
faced
him
her
four
calloused
hands
set
firmly
on
her
broad
hips
her
eyes
were
reddened
from
staring
into
the
furnace
in
which
she
heated
her
metal
sweat
ran
down
her
wrinkled
face
into
the
sparse
gray
mustache
which
disfigured
her
upper
lip
and
dripped
onto
her
bare
chest
sure
i
make
knives
she
snapped
honest
knives
not
pig
stickers
like
you
want
me
to
make
knives
as
long
as
your
arm
ptui
she
spat
at
the
cherry
red
lip
of
the
furnace
listen
you
old
crew
bait
jim
replied
evenly
you
ll
make
knives
the
way
i
tell
you
to
or
i
ll
toast
your
feet
in
your
own
furnace
hear
me
forty
one
was
struck
speechless
no
one
ever
talked
back
to
the
mother
of
blades
the
boss
was
certainly
a
man
of
power
the
knifemaker
suddenly
cracked
but
that
s
not
the
right
way
to
make
knives
she
complained
shrilly
they
wouldn
t
balance
right
i
ll
show
you
she
snatched
up
two
braces
of
knives
from
her
workbench
and
let
fly
at
a
cross
shaped
target
across
the
room
not
in
succession
but
all
four
arms
swinging
together
all
four
blades
in
the
air
at
once
they
spwiged
into
the
target
a
blade
at
the
extreme
end
of
each
arm
of
the
cross
see
you
couldn
t
do
that
with
a
long
knife
it
would
fight
with
itself
and
not
go
straight
boss
forty
one
tried
again
joe
jim
handed
him
a
mouthful
of
knuckles
without
looking
around
i
see
your
point
jim
told
the
knifemaker
but
we
don
t
want
these
knives
for
throwing
we
want
them
for
cutting
and
stabbing
up
close
get
on
with
it
i
want
to
see
the
first
one
before
you
eat
again
the
old
woman
bit
her
lip
do
i
get
my
usuals
she
said
sharply
certainly
you
get
your
usuals
he
assured
her
a
tithe
on
every
kill
till
the
blades
are
paid
for
and
good
eating
all
the
time
you
work
she
shrugged
her
misshapen
shoulders
o
k
she
turned
tonged
up
a
long
flat
fragment
of
steel
with
her
two
left
hands
and
clanged
the
stock
into
the
furnace
joe
jim
turned
to
forty
one
what
is
it
joe
asked
boss
ertz
sent
me
to
get
hugh
well
why
didn
t
you
do
it
i
don
t
find
him
bobo
says
he
s
gone
up
to
no
weight
well
go
get
him
no
that
won
t
do
you
wouldn
t
know
where
to
find
him
i
ll
have
to
do
it
myself
go
back
to
ertz
and
tell
him
to
wait
forty
one
hurried
off
the
boss
was
all
right
but
it
was
not
good
to
tarry
in
his
presence
now
you
ve
got
us
running
errands
jim
commented
sourly
how
do
you
like
being
a
blood
brother
joe
you
got
us
into
this
so
the
blood
swearing
was
your
idea
damn
it
you
know
why
i
did
that
they
took
it
seriously
and
we
are
going
to
need
all
the
help
we
can
get
if
we
are
to
get
out
of
this
with
a
skin
that
will
hold
water
oh
so
you
didn
t
take
it
seriously
did
you
jim
smiled
cynically
just
about
as
seriously
as
you
do
my
dear
deceitful
brother
as
matters
stand
now
it
is
much
much
healthier
for
you
and
me
to
keep
to
the
bargain
right
up
to
the
hilt
all
for
one
and
one
for
all
you
ve
been
reading
dumas
again
and
why
not
that
s
o
k
but
don
t
be
a
damn
fool
about
it
i
won
t
be
i
know
which
side
of
the
blade
is
edged
joe
jim
found
squatty
and
pig
sleeping
outside
the
door
which
led
to
the
control
room
he
knew
then
that
hugh
must
be
inside
for
he
had
assigned
the
two
as
personal
bodyguards
to
hugh
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
anyhow
if
hugh
had
gone
up
to
no
weight
he
would
be
heading
either
for
main
drive
or
the
control
room
more
probably
the
control
room
the
place
held
a
tremendous
fascination
for
hugh
ever
since
the
earlier
time
when
joe
jim
had
almost
literally
dragged
him
into
the
control
room
and
had
forced
him
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
that
the
ship
was
not
the
whole
world
but
simply
a
vessel
adrift
in
a
much
larger
world
a
vessel
that
could
be
driven
and
moved
ever
since
that
time
and
throughout
the
period
that
followed
while
he
was
still
a
captured
slave
of
joe
jim
s
he
had
been
obsessed
with
the
idea
of
moving
the
ship
of
sitting
at
the
controls
and
making
it
go
it
meant
more
to
him
than
it
could
possibly
have
meant
to
a
space
pilot
from
earth
from
the
time
that
the
first
rocket
made
the
little
jump
from
terra
to
the
moon
the
spaceship
pilot
has
been
the
standard
romantic
hero
whom
every
boy
wished
to
emulate
but
hugh
s
ambition
was
of
no
such
picayune
caliber
he
wished
to
move
his
world
in
earth
standards
and
concepts
it
would
be
less
ambitious
to
dream
of
equipping
the
sun
with
jets
and
go
gunning
it
around
the
galaxy
young
archimedes
had
his
lever
he
sought
a
fulcrum
joe
jim
paused
at
the
door
of
the
great
silver
stellarium
globe
which
constituted
the
control
room
and
peered
in
he
could
not
see
hugh
but
he
knew
that
he
must
be
at
the
controls
in
the
chair
of
the
chief
astrogator
for
the
lights
were
being
manipulated
the
images
of
the
stars
were
scattered
over
the
inner
surface
of
the
sphere
producing
a
simulacrum
of
the
heavens
outside
the
ship
the
illusion
was
not
fully
convincing
from
the
door
where
joe
jim
rested
from
the
center
of
the
sphere
it
would
be
complete
sector
by
sector
the
stars
snuffed
out
as
hugh
manipulated
the
controls
from
the
center
of
the
sphere
a
sector
was
left
shining
on
the
far
side
forward
it
was
marked
by
a
large
and
brilliant
orb
many
times
as
bright
as
its
companions
joe
jim
ceased
watching
and
pulled
himself
hand
over
hand
up
to
the
control
chairs
hugh
jim
called
out
who
s
there
demanded
hugh
and
leaned
his
head
out
of
the
deep
chair
oh
it
s
you
hello
ertz
wants
to
see
you
come
on
out
of
there
o
k
but
come
here
first
i
want
to
show
you
something
nuts
to
him
joe
said
to
his
brother
but
jim
answered
oh
come
on
and
see
what
it
is
won
t
take
long
the
twins
climbed
into
the
control
station
and
settled
down
in
the
chair
next
to
hugh
s
what
s
up
that
star
out
there
said
hugh
pointing
at
the
brilliant
one
it
s
grown
bigger
since
the
last
time
i
was
here
huh
sure
it
has
it
s
been
getting
brighter
for
a
long
time
couldn
t
see
it
at
all
first
time
i
was
ever
in
here
then
we
re
closer
to
it
of
course
agreed
joe
i
knew
that
it
just
goes
to
prove
that
the
ship
is
moving
but
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
about
this
about
what
about
that
star
about
the
way
it
s
been
growing
bigger
what
difference
does
it
make
what
difference
does
it
make
why
good
jordan
man
that
s
it
that
s
where
we
re
going
that
s
the
end
of
the
trip
joe
jim
both
of
him
was
momentarily
startled
not
being
himself
concerned
with
any
objective
other
than
his
own
safety
and
comfort
it
was
hard
for
him
to
realize
that
hugh
and
perhaps
bill
ertz
as
well
held
as
their
first
objective
the
recapturing
of
the
lost
accomplishments
of
their
ancestors
high
order
to
complete
the
long
forgotten
half
mythical
trip
to
far
centaurus
jim
recovered
himself
hm
m
m
maybe
what
makes
you
think
that
star
is
far
centaurus
maybe
it
isn
t
i
don
t
care
but
it
s
the
star
we
are
closest
to
and
we
are
moving
toward
it
when
we
don
t
know
which
star
is
which
one
is
as
good
as
another
joe
jim
the
ancients
must
have
had
some
way
of
telling
the
stars
apart
sure
they
did
joe
confirmed
but
what
of
it
you
ve
picked
the
one
you
want
to
go
to
come
on
i
want
to
get
back
down
all
right
hugh
agreed
reluctantly
they
began
the
long
trip
down
ertz
sketched
out
to
joe
jim
and
hugh
his
interview
with
narby
now
my
idea
in
coming
up
he
continued
is
this
i
ll
send
alan
back
down
to
heavy
weight
with
a
message
to
narby
telling
him
that
i
ve
been
able
to
get
in
contact
with
you
hugh
and
urging
him
to
meet
us
somewhere
above
crew
country
to
hear
what
i
ve
found
out
why
don
t
you
simply
go
back
and
fetch
him
yourself
objected
hugh
ertz
looked
slightly
sheepish
because
you
tried
that
method
on
me
and
it
didn
t
work
you
returned
from
mutie
country
and
told
me
the
wonders
you
had
seen
i
didn
t
believe
you
and
had
you
tried
for
heresy
if
joe
jim
hadn
t
rescued
you
you
would
have
gone
to
the
converter
if
you
had
not
hauled
me
up
to
no
weight
and
forced
me
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
i
never
would
have
believed
you
i
assure
you
narby
won
t
be
any
easier
a
lock
to
force
than
i
was
i
want
to
get
him
up
here
then
show
him
the
stars
and
make
him
see
peacefully
if
we
can
by
force
if
we
must
i
don
t
get
it
said
joe
why
wouldn
t
it
be
simpler
to
cut
his
throat
it
would
be
a
pleasure
but
it
wouldn
t
be
smart
narby
can
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
help
to
us
jim
if
you
knew
the
ship
s
organization
the
way
i
do
you
would
see
why
narby
carries
more
weight
in
the
council
than
any
other
ship
s
officer
and
he
speaks
for
the
captain
if
we
win
him
over
we
may
never
have
to
fight
at
all
if
we
don
t
well
i
m
not
sure
of
the
outcome
not
if
we
have
to
fight
i
don
t
think
he
ll
come
up
he
ll
suspect
a
trap
which
is
another
reason
why
alan
must
go
rather
than
myself
he
would
ask
me
a
lot
of
embarrassing
questions
and
be
dubious
about
the
answers
alan
he
won
t
expect
so
much
of
ertz
turned
to
alan
and
continued
alan
you
don
t
know
anything
when
he
asks
you
but
just
what
i
m
about
to
tell
you
savvy
sure
i
don
t
know
nothing
i
ain
t
seen
nothing
i
ain
t
heard
nothing
with
frank
simplicity
he
added
i
never
did
know
much
good
you
ve
never
laid
eyes
on
joe
jim
you
ve
never
heard
of
the
stars
you
re
just
my
messenger
a
knife
i
took
along
to
help
me
now
here
s
what
you
are
to
tell
him
he
gave
alan
the
message
for
narby
couched
in
simple
but
provocative
terms
then
made
sure
that
alan
had
it
all
straight
all
right
on
your
way
good
eating
alan
slapped
the
grip
of
his
knife
answered
good
eating
and
sped
away
it
is
not
possible
for
a
peasant
to
burst
precipitously
into
the
presence
of
the
captain
s
executive
alan
found
that
out
he
was
halted
by
the
master
at
arms
on
watch
outside
narby
s
suite
cuffed
around
a
bit
for
his
insistence
on
entering
referred
to
a
boredly
unsympathetic
clerk
who
took
his
name
and
told
him
to
return
to
his
village
and
wait
to
be
summoned
he
held
his
ground
and
insisted
that
he
had
a
message
of
immediate
importance
from
the
chief
engineer
to
commander
narby
the
clerk
looked
up
again
give
me
the
writing
there
is
no
writing
what
that
s
ridiculous
there
is
always
a
writing
regulations
he
had
no
time
to
make
a
writing
he
gave
me
a
word
message
what
is
it
alan
shook
his
head
it
is
private
for
commander
narby
only
i
have
orders
the
clerk
looked
his
exasperation
but
being
only
a
probationer
he
forewent
the
satisfaction
of
direct
and
immediate
disciplining
of
the
recalcitrant
churl
in
favor
of
the
safer
course
of
passing
the
buck
higher
up
the
chief
clerk
was
brief
give
me
the
message
alan
braced
himself
and
spoke
to
a
scientist
in
a
fashion
be
had
never
used
in
his
life
even
to
one
as
junior
as
this
passed
clerk
sir
all
i
ask
is
for
you
to
tell
commrnder
narby
that
i
have
a
message
for
him
from
chief
engineer
ertz
if
the
message
is
not
delivered
i
won
t
be
the
one
to
go
to
the
converter
but
i
don
t
dare
give
the
message
to
anyone
else
the
under
official
pulled
at
his
lip
and
decided
to
take
a
chance
on
disturbing
his
superior
alan
delivered
his
message
to
narby
in
a
low
voice
in
order
that
the
orderly
standing
just
outside
the
door
might
not
overhear
narby
stared
at
him
ertz
wants
me
to
come
along
with
you
up
to
mutie
country
not
all
the
way
up
to
mutie
country
sir
to
a
point
in
between
where
hugh
hoyland
can
meet
you
narby
exhaled
noisily
it
s
preposterous
i
ll
send
a
squad
of
knives
up
to
fetch
him
down
to
me
alan
delivered
the
balance
of
his
message
this
time
he
carefully
raised
his
voice
to
ensure
that
the
orderly
and
if
possible
others
might
hear
his
words
ertz
said
to
tell
you
that
if
you
were
afraid
to
go
just
to
forget
the
whole
matter
he
will
take
it
up
with
the
council
himself
alan
owed
his
continued
existence
thereafter
to
the
fact
that
narby
was
the
sort
of
man
who
lived
by
shrewdness
rather
than
by
direct
force
narby
s
knife
was
at
his
belt
alan
was
painfully
aware
that
he
had
been
required
to
deposit
his
own
with
the
master
at
arms
narby
controlled
his
expression
he
was
too
intelligent
to
attribute
the
insult
to
the
oaf
before
him
though
he
promised
himself
to
give
said
oaf
a
little
special
attention
at
a
more
convenient
time
pique
curiosity
and
potential
loss
of
face
all
entered
into
his
decision
i
m
coming
with
you
he
said
savagely
i
want
to
ask
him
if
you
got
his
message
straight
narby
considered
having
a
major
guard
called
out
to
accompany
him
but
he
discarded
the
idea
not
only
would
it
make
the
affair
extremely
public
before
he
had
an
opportunity
to
judge
its
political
aspects
but
also
it
would
cost
him
almost
as
much
face
as
simply
refusing
to
go
but
he
inquired
nervously
of
alan
as
alan
retrieved
his
weapon
from
the
master
at
arms
you
re
a
good
knife
none
better
alan
agreed
cheerfully
narby
hoped
that
the
man
was
not
simply
boasting
muties
narby
wished
that
he
himself
had
found
more
time
lately
for
practice
in
the
manly
arts
narby
gradually
regained
his
composure
as
he
followed
alan
up
toward
low
weight
in
the
first
place
nothing
happened
no
alarms
in
the
second
place
alan
was
obviously
a
cautious
and
competent
scout
one
who
moved
alert
and
noiselessly
and
never
entered
a
deck
without
pausing
to
peer
cautiously
around
before
letting
his
body
follow
his
eye
narby
might
have
been
more
nervous
had
be
hearing
what
alan
did
hear
little
noises
from
the
depths
of
the
great
dim
passageways
rustlings
which
told
him
that
their
progress
was
flanked
on
all
sides
this
worried
alan
subconsciously
although
he
had
expected
something
of
the
sort
he
knew
that
both
hugh
and
joe
jim
were
careful
captains
who
would
not
neglect
to
cover
an
approach
he
would
have
worried
more
if
he
had
not
been
able
detect
a
reconnaissance
which
should
have
been
present
when
he
approached
the
rendezvous
some
twenty
decks
above
the
highest
civilized
level
he
stopped
and
whistled
a
whistle
answered
him
it
s
alan
he
called
out
come
up
and
show
yourself
alan
did
so
without
neglecting
his
usual
caution
when
be
saw
no
one
but
his
friends
ertz
hugh
joe
jim
and
bobo
be
motioned
for
narby
to
foflow
him
the
sight
of
joe
jim
and
bobo
broke
narby
s
unsteady
calm
with
a
sudden
feeling
that
he
had
been
trapped
he
snatched
at
his
knife
and
backed
clumsily
down
the
stair
then
turned
bobo
s
knife
was
out
even
faster
for
a
split
moment
the
outcome
hung
balanced
ready
to
fall
either
way
but
joe
jim
slapped
bobo
across
the
face
took
his
knife
from
him
and
let
it
clatter
to
the
deck
then
relieved
him
of
his
slingshot
narby
was
in
full
flight
with
hugh
and
ertz
calling
vainly
after
him
fetch
him
bobo
jim
commanded
and
do
not
hurt
him
bobo
lumbered
away
he
was
back
in
fairly
short
order
run
fast
be
commented
he
dropped
narby
to
the
deck
where
the
officer
lay
almost
quiet
while
he
fought
to
catch
his
breath
bobo
took
narby
s
knife
from
his
own
belt
and
tried
it
by
shaving
coarse
black
hairs
from
his
left
forearm
good
blade
he
approved
give
it
back
to
him
jim
ordered
bobo
looked
extremely
startled
but
complied
wistfully
joe
jim
returned
bobo
s
own
weapons
to
him
narby
matched
bobo
s
surprise
at
regaining
his
sidearm
but
he
concealed
it
better
he
even
managed
to
accept
it
with
dignity
look
ertz
began
in
worried
tones
i
m
sorry
you
got
your
wind
up
fin
bobo
s
not
a
bad
sort
it
was
the
only
way
to
get
you
back
narby
fought
with
himself
to
regain
the
cool
self
discipline
with
which
he
habitually
met
the
world
damn
he
told
himself
this
situation
is
preposterous
well
forget
it
he
said
shortly
i
was
expecting
to
meet
you
i
didn
t
expect
a
bunch
of
armed
muties
you
have
an
odd
taste
in
playmates
ertz
sorry
bill
ertz
replied
i
guess
i
should
have
warned
you
a
piece
of
mendacious
diplomacy
but
they
re
all
right
bobo
you
ve
met
this
is
joe
jim
he
s
a
a
sort
of
a
ship
s
officer
among
the
muties
good
eating
joe
acknowledged
politely
good
eating
narby
replied
mechanically
hugh
you
know
i
think
narby
agreed
that
he
did
an
embarrassed
pause
followed
narby
broke
it
well
he
said
you
must
have
had
some
reason
to
send
word
for
me
to
come
up
here
or
was
it
just
to
play
games
i
did
ertz
agreed
i
shucks
i
hardly
know
where
to
start
see
here
narby
you
won
t
believe
this
but
i
ve
seen
everything
hugh
told
us
was
true
i
ve
been
in
the
control
room
i
ve
seen
the
stars
i
know
narby
stared
at
him
ertz
he
said
slowly
you
ve
gone
out
of
your
mind
hugh
hoyland
spoke
up
excitedly
that
s
because
you
haven
t
seen
it
moves
look
you
the
ship
moves
like
a
fit
handle
this
ertz
cut
in
listen
to
me
narby
what
it
all
means
you
will
soon
decide
for
yourself
but
i
can
tell
you
what
i
saw
they
took
me
up
to
no
weight
and
into
the
captain
s
veranda
that
s
a
compartment
with
a
glass
wall
you
can
stare
right
out
through
into
a
great
black
empty
space
big
bigger
than
anything
could
be
bigger
than
the
ship
and
there
were
lights
out
there
stars
just
like
the
ancient
myths
said
narby
looked
both
amazed
and
disgusted
where
s
your
logic
man
i
thought
you
were
a
scientist
what
do
you
mean
bigger
than
the
ship
that
s
an
absurdity
a
contradiction
in
terms
by
definition
the
ship
is
the
ship
all
else
is
a
part
of
it
ertz
shrugged
helplessly
i
know
it
sounds
that
way
i
can
t
explain
it
it
defies
all
logic
it
s
oh
huff
you
ll
know
what
i
mean
when
you
see
it
control
yourself
narby
advised
him
don
t
talk
nonsense
a
thing
is
logical
or
it
isn
t
for
a
thing
to
be
it
must
occupy
space
you
ve
seen
or
thought
you
saw
something
remarkable
but
whatever
it
was
it
can
be
no
larger
than
the
compartment
it
was
in
you
can
t
show
me
anything
that
contradicts
an
obvious
fact
of
nature
i
told
you
i
couldn
t
explain
it
of
course
you
can
t
the
twins
had
been
whispering
disgustedly
one
head
to
the
other
stop
the
chatter
joe
said
in
louder
tones
we
re
ready
to
go
come
on
sure
ertz
agreed
eagerly
let
s
drop
it
narby
until
you
have
seen
it
come
on
now
it
s
a
long
climb
what
narby
demanded
say
what
is
this
go
where
up
to
the
captain
s
veranda
and
the
control
room
me
don
t
be
ridiculous
i
m
going
down
at
once
no
narby
ertz
denied
that
s
why
i
sent
for
you
you
ve
got
to
see
don
t
be
silly
i
don
t
need
to
see
common
sense
gives
sufficient
answer
however
he
went
on
i
do
want
to
congratulate
you
on
making
a
friendly
contact
with
the
muties
we
should
be
able
to
work
out
some
means
of
cooperation
i
think
joe
jim
took
one
step
forward
you
re
wasting
time
he
said
evenly
we
re
going
up
you
too
i
really
do
insist
narby
shook
his
head
it
s
out
of
the
question
some
other
time
perhaps
after
we
have
worked
out
a
method
of
cooperation
hugh
stepped
in
closer
to
him
from
the
other
side
you
don
t
seem
to
understand
you
re
going
now
narby
glanced
the
other
way
at
ertz
ertz
nodded
that
s
how
it
is
narby
narby
cursed
himself
silently
great
jordan
what
in
the
ship
was
he
thinking
of
to
let
himself
get
into
such
a
position
he
had
a
distinct
feeling
that
the
two
headed
man
would
rather
that
he
showed
fight
impossible
preposterous
situation
he
cursed
again
to
himself
but
gave
way
as
gracefully
as
he
could
oh
well
rather
than
cause
an
argument
i
ll
go
now
let
s
get
on
with
it
which
way
just
stick
with
me
advised
ertz
joe
jim
whistled
loudly
in
a
set
pattern
muties
seemed
to
grow
out
of
the
floor
plates
the
bulkheads
the
overhead
until
six
or
eight
more
had
been
added
to
the
party
narby
was
suddenly
sick
with
the
full
realization
of
just
how
far
he
had
strayed
from
the
way
of
caution
the
party
moved
up
it
took
them
a
long
time
to
get
up
to
no
weight
as
narby
was
not
used
to
climbing
the
steady
reduction
in
weight
as
they
rose
from
deck
to
deck
relieved
him
somewhat
but
the
help
afforded
was
more
than
offset
by
the
stomach
qualms
he
felt
as
weight
dropped
away
from
him
he
did
not
have
a
true
attack
of
space
sickness
like
all
born
in
the
ship
muties
and
crew
he
was
more
or
less
acclimated
to
lessened
weight
but
he
had
done
practically
no
climbing
since
reckless
adolescence
by
the
time
they
reached
the
innermost
deck
of
the
ship
he
was
acutely
uncomfortable
and
hardly
able
to
proceed
joe
jim
sent
the
added
members
of
the
party
back
below
and
told
bobo
to
carry
narby
narby
waved
him
away
i
can
make
it
he
protested
and
by
sheer
stubborn
will
forced
his
body
to
behave
joe
jim
looked
him
over
and
countermanded
the
order
by
the
time
a
long
series
of
gliding
dives
had
carried
them
as
far
forward
as
the
transverse
bulkhead
beyond
which
lay
the
control
room
he
was
reasonably
comfortable
again
they
did
not
stop
first
at
the
control
room
but
in
accordance
with
a
plan
of
hugh
s
continued
on
to
the
captain
s
veranda
narby
was
braced
for
what
he
saw
there
not
only
by
ertz
s
confused
explanation
but
because
hugh
had
chattered
buoyantly
to
him
about
it
all
the
latter
part
of
the
trip
hugh
was
feeling
warmly
friendly
to
narby
by
the
time
they
arrived
it
was
wonderful
to
have
somebody
to
listen
hugh
floated
in
through
the
door
ahead
of
the
others
executed
a
neat
turn
in
mid
air
and
steadied
himself
with
one
hand
on
the
back
of
the
captain
s
easy
chair
with
the
other
he
waved
at
the
great
view
port
and
the
starry
firmament
beyond
it
there
it
is
he
exulted
there
it
is
look
at
it
isn
t
it
wonderful
narby
s
face
showed
no
expression
but
he
looked
long
and
intently
at
the
brilliant
display
remarkable
he
conceded
at
last
remarkable
i
ve
never
seen
anything
like
it
remarkable
ain
t
half
protested
hugh
wonderful
is
the
word
o
k
wonderful
narby
assented
those
bright
little
lights
you
say
those
are
the
stars
that
the
ancients
talked
about
why
yes
agreed
hugh
feeling
slightly
disconcerted
without
knowing
why
only
they
re
not
little
they
re
big
enormous
things
like
the
ship
they
just
look
little
because
they
are
so
far
away
see
that
very
bright
one
that
big
one
down
to
the
left
it
looks
big
because
it
s
closer
i
think
that
is
far
centaurus
but
i
m
not
sure
he
admitted
in
a
burst
of
frankness
narby
glanced
quickly
at
him
then
back
to
the
big
star
how
far
away
is
it
i
don
t
know
but
we
ll
find
out
there
are
instruments
to
measure
such
things
in
the
control
room
but
i
haven
t
got
the
hang
of
them
entirely
it
doesn
t
matter
though
we
ll
get
there
yet
huh
sure
finish
the
trip
narby
looked
blank
but
said
nothing
his
was
a
careful
and
orderly
mind
logical
to
a
high
degree
he
was
a
capable
executive
and
could
make
rapid
decisions
when
necessary
but
he
was
by
nature
inclined
to
reserve
his
opinions
when
possible
until
he
had
had
time
to
chew
over
the
data
and
assess
it
he
was
even
more
taciturn
in
the
control
room
he
listened
and
looked
but
asked
very
few
questions
hugh
did
not
care
this
was
his
toy
his
gadget
his
baby
to
show
it
off
to
someone
who
had
never
seen
it
and
who
would
listen
was
all
he
asked
at
ertz
s
suggestion
the
party
stopped
at
joe
jim
s
apartment
on
the
way
back
down
narby
must
be
committed
to
the
same
course
of
action
as
the
blood
brotherhood
and
plans
must
be
made
to
carry
out
such
action
if
the
stratagem
which
brought
narby
to
them
was
to
be
fruitful
narby
agreed
to
stop
unreluctantly
having
become
convinced
of
the
reality
of
the
truce
under
which
he
made
this
unprecedented
sortie
into
mutie
country
he
listened
quietly
while
ertz
outlined
what
they
had
in
mind
he
was
still
quiet
when
ertz
had
finished
well
said
ertz
at
last
when
the
silence
had
dragged
on
long
enough
to
get
on
his
nerves
you
expect
some
comment
from
me
yes
of
course
you
figure
into
it
narby
knew
that
he
did
and
knew
that
an
answer
was
expected
from
him
he
was
stalling
for
time
well
narby
pursed
his
lips
and
fitted
his
fingertips
together
it
seems
to
me
that
this
problem
divides
itself
into
two
parts
hugh
hoyland
as
i
understand
it
your
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
ancient
plan
of
jordan
cannot
be
realized
until
the
ship
as
a
whole
is
pacified
and
brought
under
one
rule
you
need
order
and
discipline
for
your
purpose
from
crew
country
clear
to
the
control
room
is
that
right
certainly
we
have
to
man
the
main
drive
and
that
means
please
frankly
i
am
not
qualified
to
understand
things
that
i
have
seen
so
recently
and
have
had
no
opportunity
to
study
as
to
your
chances
of
success
in
that
project
i
would
prefer
to
rely
on
the
opinion
of
the
chief
engineer
your
problem
is
the
second
phase
it
appears
that
you
are
necessarily
interested
in
the
first
phase
of
course
then
let
s
talk
about
the
first
phase
only
it
involves
matters
of
public
policy
and
administration
i
feel
more
at
home
there
perhaps
my
advice
will
be
useful
joe
jim
i
understand
that
you
ate
looking
for
an
opportunity
to
effect
a
peace
between
the
muties
and
the
members
of
the
crew
peace
and
good
eating
right
that
s
correct
jim
agreed
good
it
has
been
my
purpose
for
a
long
time
and
that
of
many
of
the
ship
s
officers
frankly
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
could
be
achieved
other
than
by
sheer
force
we
had
steeled
ourselves
to
the
prospect
of
a
long
and
difficult
and
bloody
war
the
records
of
the
oldest
witness
handed
down
to
him
by
his
predecessors
clear
back
to
the
time
of
the
mythical
mutiny
make
no
mention
of
anything
but
war
between
muties
and
the
crew
but
this
is
a
better
way
i
am
delighted
then
you
re
with
us
exclaimed
ertz
steady
there
are
many
other
things
to
be
considered
ertz
you
and
i
know
and
hoyland
as
well
i
should
think
that
not
all
of
the
ship
s
officers
will
agree
with
us
what
of
that
that
s
easy
put
in
hugh
hoyland
bring
them
up
to
no
weight
one
at
a
time
let
them
see
the
stars
and
learn
the
truth
narby
shook
his
head
you
have
the
litter
carrying
the
porters
i
told
you
this
problem
is
in
two
phases
there
is
no
point
in
trying
to
convince
a
man
of
something
he
won
t
believe
when
you
need
him
to
agree
to
something
he
can
understand
after
the
ship
is
consolidated
it
will
be
simple
enough
then
to
let
the
officers
experience
the
control
room
and
the
stars
but
he
s
right
ertz
stopped
him
no
use
getting
cluttered
up
with
a
lot
of
religious
issues
when
the
immediate
problem
is
a
practical
one
there
are
numerous
officers
whom
we
could
get
on
our
side
for
the
purpose
of
pacifying
the
ship
who
would
raise
all
kinds
of
fuss
if
we
tackled
them
first
on
the
idea
that
the
ship
moves
but
no
buts
about
it
narby
is
right
it
s
common
sense
now
narby
about
this
matter
of
those
officers
who
may
not
be
convinced
here
s
how
we
see
it
in
the
first
place
it
s
your
business
and
mine
to
win
over
as
many
as
we
can
any
who
hold
out
against
us
well
the
converter
is
always
hungry
narby
nodded
completely
undismayed
by
the
idea
of
assassination
as
a
policy
that
seems
the
safest
plan
mightn
t
it
be
a
little
bit
difficult
that
is
where
joe
jim
comes
in
we
ll
have
the
best
knives
in
the
ship
to
back
us
up
i
see
joe
jim
is
i
take
it
boss
of
all
the
muties
what
gave
you
that
idea
growled
joe
vexed
without
knowing
why
why
i
supposed
i
was
given
to
understand
narby
stopped
no
one
had
told
him
that
joe
jim
was
king
of
the
upper
decks
he
had
assumed
it
from
appearances
he
felt
suddenly
very
uneasy
had
he
been
negotiating
uselessly
what
was
the
point
in
a
pact
with
this
two
headed
monstrosity
if
he
did
not
speak
for
the
muties
i
should
have
made
that
clear
ertz
said
hastily
joe
jim
helps
us
to
establish
a
new
administration
then
we
will
be
able
to
back
him
up
with
knives
to
pacify
the
rest
of
the
muties
joe
jim
isn
t
boss
of
all
the
muties
but
he
has
the
largest
strongest
gang
with
our
help
he
soon
will
be
boss
of
all
of
them
narby
quickly
adjusted
his
mind
to
the
new
data
muties
against
muties
with
only
a
little
help
from
the
cadets
of
the
crew
seemed
to
him
a
good
way
to
fight
on
second
thoughts
it
was
better
than
an
outright
truce
at
once
for
there
would
be
fewer
muties
to
administer
when
it
was
all
over
less
chance
of
another
mutiny
i
see
he
agreed
so
have
you
considered
what
the
situation
will
be
afterwards
what
do
you
mean
inquired
hoyland
can
you
picture
the
present
captain
carrying
out
these
plans
ertz
saw
what
he
was
driving
at
and
so
did
hoyland
vaguely
go
on
said
ertz
who
is
to
be
the
new
captain
narby
looked
squarely
at
ertz
ertz
had
not
thought
the
matter
through
he
realized
now
that
the
question
was
very
pertinent
if
the
coup
d
etat
was
not
to
be
followed
by
a
bloody
scramble
for
power
he
had
permitted
himself
to
dream
of
being
selected
as
captain
sometime
but
he
knew
that
narby
was
pointed
that
way
too
ertz
had
been
as
honestly
struck
by
the
romantic
notion
of
moving
the
ship
as
hoyland
he
realized
that
his
old
ambition
stood
in
the
way
of
the
plan
he
renounced
the
old
with
only
a
touch
of
wistfulness
you
will
have
to
be
captain
fin
are
you
willing
to
be
phineas
narby
accepted
gracefully
i
suppose
so
if
that
s
the
way
you
want
it
you
would
make
a
fine
captain
yourself
ertz
ertz
shook
his
head
understanding
perfectly
that
narby
s
full
cooperation
turned
on
this
point
i
ll
continue
chief
engineer
i
want
to
handle
the
main
drive
of
the
trip
slow
down
joe
interrupted
i
don
t
agree
to
this
why
should
he
be
captain
narby
faced
him
do
you
want
to
be
captain
he
kept
his
voice
carefully
free
of
sarcasm
a
mutie
for
captain
huff
s
name
no
but
why
should
you
be
why
not
ertz
or
hugh
not
me
hugh
disclaimed
i
ll
have
no
time
for
administration
i
m
the
astrogator
seriously
joe
jim
ertz
explained
narby
is
the
one
of
the
group
who
can
get
the
necessary
cooperation
out
of
the
ship
s
officers
damn
it
if
they
won
t
cooperate
we
can
slit
their
throats
with
narby
as
captain
we
won
t
have
to
slit
throats
i
don
t
like
it
groused
joe
his
brother
shushed
why
get
excited
about
it
joe
jordan
knows
we
don
t
want
the
responsibility
i
quite
understand
your
misgivings
narby
suggested
suavely
but
i
don
t
think
you
need
worry
i
would
forced
to
depend
on
you
of
course
to
administer
the
muties
i
would
administer
the
lower
decks
a
job
i
am
used
to
and
you
would
be
vice
captain
if
you
are
willing
serve
for
the
muties
it
would
be
folly
for
me
to
attempt
to
administer
directly
a
part
of
the
ship
i
m
not
familiar
with
and
people
whose
customs
i
don
t
know
i
really
can
t
accept
the
captaincy
unless
you
are
willing
to
help
me
in
that
fashion
will
you
do
it
i
don
t
want
any
part
of
it
protested
joe
i
m
sorry
then
i
must
refuse
to
be
captain
i
really
can
t
undertake
it
if
you
won
t
help
me
that
much
oh
go
ahead
joe
jim
insisted
let
s
take
it
for
the
time
being
at
least
the
job
has
to
be
done
all
right
joe
capitulated
but
i
don
t
like
it
narby
ignored
the
fact
that
joe
jim
had
not
specifically
agreed
to
narby
s
elevation
to
the
captaincy
no
further
mention
was
made
of
it
the
discussion
of
ways
and
means
was
tedious
and
need
not
be
repeated
it
was
agreed
that
ertz
alan
and
narby
should
all
return
to
their
usual
haunts
and
occupations
while
preparations
were
made
to
strike
hugh
detailed
a
guard
to
see
them
safely
down
to
high
weight
you
ll
send
alan
up
when
you
are
ready
he
said
to
narby
as
they
were
about
to
leave
yes
narby
agreed
but
don
t
expect
him
soon
ertz
and
i
will
have
to
have
time
to
feel
out
friends
and
there
s
the
matter
of
the
old
captain
i
ll
have
to
persuade
him
to
call
a
meeting
of
all
the
ship
s
officers
he
s
never
too
easy
to
handle
well
that
s
your
job
good
eating
good
eating
on
the
few
occasions
when
the
scientist
priests
who
ruled
the
ship
under
jordan
s
captain
met
in
full
assembly
they
gathered
in
a
great
hall
directly
above
the
ship
s
offices
on
the
last
civilized
deck
forgotten
generations
past
before
the
time
of
the
mutiny
led
by
ship
s
metalsmith
roy
huff
the
hall
had
been
a
gymnasium
a
place
for
fun
and
healthy
exercise
as
planned
by
the
designers
of
the
great
starship
but
the
present
users
knew
nothing
of
that
narby
watched
the
roster
clerk
check
off
the
ship
s
officers
as
they
arrived
worried
under
a
bland
countenance
there
were
only
a
few
more
to
arrive
he
would
soon
have
no
excuse
not
to
notify
the
captain
that
the
meeting
was
ready
but
he
had
received
no
word
from
joe
jim
and
hoyland
had
that
fool
alan
managed
to
get
himself
killed
on
the
way
up
to
deliver
the
word
had
he
fallen
and
broken
his
worthless
neck
was
he
dead
with
a
mutie
s
knife
in
his
belly
ertz
came
in
and
before
seeking
his
seat
among
the
department
heads
went
up
to
where
narby
sat
in
front
of
the
captain
s
chair
how
about
it
he
inquired
softly
all
right
narby
told
him
but
no
word
yet
hm
m
m
ertz
turned
around
and
assayed
his
support
in
the
crowd
narby
did
likewise
not
a
majority
not
a
certain
majority
for
anything
as
drastic
as
this
still
the
issue
would
not
depend
on
voting
the
roster
clerk
touched
his
arm
all
present
sir
except
those
excused
for
sickness
and
one
on
watch
at
the
converter
narby
directed
that
the
captain
be
notified
with
a
sick
feeling
that
something
had
gone
wrong
the
captain
as
usual
with
complete
disregard
for
the
comfort
and
convenience
of
others
took
his
time
about
appearing
narby
was
glad
of
the
delay
but
miserable
in
enduring
it
when
the
old
man
finally
waddled
in
flanked
by
his
orderlies
and
settled
heavily
into
his
chair
he
was
again
as
usual
impatient
to
get
the
meeting
over
he
waved
for
the
others
to
be
seated
and
started
in
on
narby
very
well
commander
narby
let
s
have
the
agenda
you
have
an
agenda
i
hope
yes
captain
there
is
an
agenda
then
have
it
read
man
have
it
read
why
are
you
delaying
yes
sir
narby
turned
to
the
reading
clerk
and
handed
him
a
sheaf
of
writings
the
clerk
glanced
at
them
looked
puzzled
but
receiving
no
encouragement
from
narby
commenced
to
read
petition
to
council
and
captain
lieutenant
braune
administrator
of
the
village
of
sector
9
being
of
frail
health
and
advanced
age
prays
that
he
be
relieved
of
all
duty
and
retired
the
clerk
continued
setting
forth
the
recommendations
of
the
officers
and
departments
concerned
the
captain
twisted
impatiently
in
his
chair
finally
interrupted
the
reading
what
is
this
narby
can
t
you
handle
routine
matters
without
all
this
fuss
i
understood
that
the
captain
was
displeased
with
the
fashion
in
which
a
similar
matter
was
lately
handled
i
have
no
wish
to
trespass
on
the
captain
s
prerogatives
nonsense
man
don
t
read
regulations
to
me
let
the
council
act
then
bring
their
decision
to
me
for
review
yes
sir
narby
took
the
writing
from
the
clerk
and
gave
him
another
the
clerk
read
it
was
an
equally
fiddling
matter
sector
3
village
because
of
an
unexplained
blight
which
had
infected
their
hydroponic
farms
prayed
for
relief
and
a
suspension
of
taxes
the
captain
put
up
with
still
less
of
this
item
before
interrupting
narby
would
have
been
sorely
pressed
for
any
excuse
to
continue
the
meeting
had
not
the
word
he
awaited
arrived
at
that
moment
it
was
a
mere
scrap
of
parchment
brought
in
from
outside
the
hall
by
one
of
his
own
men
it
contained
the
single
word
ready
narby
looked
at
it
nodded
to
ertz
and
addressed
the
captain
sir
since
you
have
no
wish
to
listen
to
the
petitions
of
your
crew
i
will
continue
at
once
with
the
main
business
of
this
meeting
the
veiled
insolence
of
the
statement
caused
the
captain
to
stare
at
him
suspiciously
but
narby
went
on
for
many
generations
through
the
lives
of
a
succession
of
witnesses
the
crew
has
suffered
from
the
depredations
of
the
muties
our
livestock
our
children
even
our
own
persons
have
been
in
constant
jeopardy
jordan
s
regulations
are
not
honored
above
the
levels
where
we
live
jordan
s
captain
himself
is
not
free
to
travel
in
the
upper
levels
of
the
ship
it
has
been
an
article
of
faith
that
jordan
so
ordained
it
that
the
children
pay
with
blood
for
the
sins
of
their
ancestors
it
was
the
will
of
jordan
we
were
told
i
for
one
have
never
been
reconciled
to
this
constant
drain
on
the
ship
s
mass
he
paused
the
old
captain
had
been
having
some
difficulty
in
believing
his
ears
but
he
found
his
voice
pointing
he
squealed
do
you
dispute
the
teachings
i
do
not
i
maintain
that
the
teachings
do
not
command
us
to
leave
the
muties
outside
the
regulations
and
never
did
i
demand
that
they
be
brought
under
the
regulations
you
you
you
are
relieved
of
duty
sir
not
answered
narby
his
insolence
now
overt
until
i
have
had
my
say
arrest
that
man
but
the
captain
s
orderlies
stood
fast
though
they
shuffled
and
looked
unhappy
narby
himself
had
selected
them
narby
turned
back
to
the
amazed
council
and
caught
the
eye
of
ertz
all
right
he
said
now
ertz
got
up
and
trotted
toward
the
door
narby
continued
many
of
you
think
as
i
do
but
we
always
supposed
that
we
would
have
to
fight
for
it
with
the
help
of
jordan
i
have
been
able
to
achieve
contact
with
the
muties
and
propose
terms
of
a
truce
their
leaders
are
coming
here
to
negotiate
with
us
there
he
pointed
dramatically
at
the
door
ertz
reappeared
following
him
came
hugh
hoyland
joe
jim
and
bobo
hoyland
turned
to
the
right
along
the
wall
and
circled
the
company
he
was
followed
single
file
by
a
string
of
muties
joe
jim
s
best
butcher
boys
another
such
column
trailed
after
joe
jim
and
bobo
to
the
left
joe
jim
hugh
and
half
a
dozen
more
in
each
wing
were
covered
with
crude
armor
which
extended
below
their
waists
the
armor
was
topped
off
with
clumsy
helms
latticeworks
of
steel
which
protected
their
heads
without
greatly
interfering
with
vision
each
of
the
armored
ones
a
few
of
the
others
carried
unheard
of
knives
long
as
a
man
s
arm
the
startled
officers
might
have
stopped
the
invasion
at
the
bottleneck
through
which
it
entered
had
they
been
warned
and
led
but
they
were
disorganized
helpless
and
their
strongest
leaders
had
invited
the
invaders
in
they
shifted
in
their
chairs
reached
for
their
knives
and
glanced
anxiously
from
one
to
another
but
no
one
made
the
first
move
which
would
start
a
general
bloodletting
narby
turned
to
the
captain
what
about
it
do
you
receive
this
delegation
in
peace
it
seemed
likely
that
age
and
fat
living
would
keep
the
captain
from
answering
from
ever
answering
anything
again
but
he
managed
to
croak
get
em
out
of
here
get
em
out
you
you
ll
make
the
trip
for
this
narby
turned
back
to
joe
jim
and
jerked
his
thumb
upward
jim
spoke
to
bobo
and
a
knife
was
buried
to
the
grip
in
the
captain
s
fat
belly
he
squawked
rather
than
screamed
and
a
look
of
utter
bewilderment
spread
over
his
features
he
plucked
awkwardly
at
the
hilt
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
really
there
mutiny
he
stated
mutiny
the
word
trailed
off
as
he
collapsed
into
his
chair
and
fell
heavily
forward
to
the
deck
on
his
face
narby
shoved
it
with
his
foot
and
spoke
to
the
two
orderlies
carry
it
outside
he
commanded
they
obeyed
seeming
relieved
at
having
something
to
do
and
someone
to
tell
them
to
do
it
narby
turned
back
to
the
silent
watching
mass
does
anyone
else
object
to
a
peace
with
the
muties
an
elderly
officer
one
who
had
dreamed
away
his
life
as
judge
and
spiritual
adviser
to
a
remote
village
stood
up
and
pointed
a
bony
finger
at
narby
while
his
white
beard
jutted
indignantly
jordan
will
punish
you
for
this
mutiny
and
sin
the
spirit
of
huff
narby
nodded
to
joe
jim
the
old
man
s
words
gurgled
in
his
throat
the
point
of
a
blade
sticking
out
under
one
ear
bobo
looked
pleased
with
himself
there
has
been
enough
talk
narby
announced
it
is
better
to
have
a
little
blood
now
than
much
blood
later
let
those
who
stand
with
me
in
this
matter
get
up
and
come
forward
ertz
set
the
precedent
by
striding
forward
and
urging
his
surest
personal
supporters
to
come
with
him
reaching
the
front
of
the
room
he
pulled
out
his
knife
and
raised
the
point
i
salute
phineas
narby
jordan
s
captain
his
own
supporters
were
left
with
no
choice
phineas
narby
jordan
s
captain
the
hard
young
men
in
narby
s
clique
the
backbone
of
the
dissident
rationalist
bloc
among
the
scientist
priests
joined
the
swing
forward
en
masse
points
raised
high
and
shouting
for
the
new
captain
the
undecided
and
the
opportunists
hastened
to
join
as
they
saw
which
side
of
the
blade
was
edged
when
the
division
was
complete
there
remained
a
handful
only
of
ship
s
officers
still
hanging
back
almost
all
of
whom
were
either
elderly
or
hyperreligious
ertz
watched
captain
narby
look
them
over
then
pick
up
joe
jim
with
his
eyes
ertz
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
there
are
few
of
them
and
practically
helpless
he
pointed
out
why
not
disarm
them
and
let
them
retire
narby
eave
him
an
unfriendly
look
let
them
stay
alive
and
breed
mutiny
i
am
quite
capable
of
making
my
own
decisions
ertz
ertz
bit
his
lip
very
well
captain
that
s
better
he
signaled
to
joe
jim
the
long
knives
made
short
work
of
it
hugh
hung

the
slaughter
his
old
teacher
lieutenant
nelson
the
village
scientist
who
had
seen
his
ability
and
selected
him
for
scientisthood
was
one
of
the
group
it
was
a
factor

not
anticipated
world
conquest
and
consolidation
faith
or
the
sword
joe
jim
s
bullies
amplified
by
hot
blooded
young
cadets
supplied
by
captain
narby
combed
the
middle
decks
and
the
upper
decks
the
muties
individualists
by
the
very
nature
of
their
existence
and
owing
no
allegiance
higher
than
that
to
the
leaders
of
their
gangs
were
no
match
for
the
planned
generalship
of
joe
jim
nor
did
their
weapons
match
the
strange
long
knives
that
bit
before
a
man
was
ready
the
rumor
spread
through
mutie
country
that
it
was
better
to
surrender
quietly
to
the
gang
of
the
two
wise
heads
good
eating
for
those
who
surrendered
death
inescapable
for
those
who
did
not
but
it
was
nevertheless
a
long
slow
process
there
were
so
many
many
decks
so
many
miles
of
gloomy
corridors
so
many
countless
compartments
in
which
unsubdued
muties
might
lurk
furthermore
the
process
grew
slower
as
it
advanced
as
joe
jim
attempted
to
establish
a
police
patrol
an
interior
guard
over
each
sector
deck
and
stair
way
trunk
as
fast
as
his
striking
groups
mopped
them
up
to
narby
s
disappointment
the
two
headed
man
was
not
killed
in
his
campaigns
joe
jim
had
learned
from
his
own
books
that
a
general
need
not
necessarily
expose
himself
to
direct
combat
hugh
buried
himself
in
the
control
room
not
only
was
he
more
interested
in
the
subtle
problems
of
mastering
the
how
and
why
of
the
complex
controls
and
the
parallel
complexity
of
starship
ballistics
but
also
the
whole
matter
of
the
blood
purge
was
distasteful
to
him
because
of
lieutenant
nelson
violence
and
death
he
was
used
to
they
were
commonplace
even
on
the
lower
levels
but
that
incident
made
him
vaguely
unhappy
even
though
his
own
evaluations
were
not
sufficiently
clean
cut
for
him
to
feel
personal
responsibility
for
the
old
man
s
death
he
just
wished
it
had
not
happened
but
the
controls
ahh
there
was
something
a
man
could
put
his
heart
into
he
was
attempting
a
task
that
an
earthman
would
have
rejected
as
impossible
an
earthmaa
would
have
known
that
the
piloting
and
operation
of
an
interstellar
ship
was
a
task
so
difficult
that
the
best
possible
technical
education
combined
with
extensive
experience
in
the
handling
of
lesser
spacecraft
would
constitute
a
barely
adequate
grounding
for
the
additional
intensive
highly
specialized
training
necessary
for
the
task
hugh
hoyland
did
not
know
that
so
he
went
ahead
and
did
it
anyhow
in
which
attempt
he
was
aided
by
the
genius
of
the
designers
the
controls
of
most
machinery
may
be
considered
under
the
head
of
simple
pairs
stop
and
go
push
and
pull
up
and
down
in
and
out
on
and
off
right
and
left
their
permutations
and
combinations
the
real
difficulties
have
to
do
with
upkeep
and
repair
adjustment
and
replacements
but
the
controls
and
main
drive
machinery
of
the
starship
vanguard
required
no
upkeep
and
no
repair
their
complexities
were
below
the
molar
level
they
contained
no
moving
parts
friction
took
no
toil
and
they
did
not
fall
out
of
adjustment
had
it
been
necessary
for
him
to
understand
and
repair
the
machines
he
dealt
with
it
would
have
been
impossible
a
fourteen
year
old
child
may
safely
be
entrusted
with
a
family
skycar
and
be
allowed
to
make
thousand
mile
jaunts
overnight
unaccompanied
it
is
much
more
probable
that
he
will
injure
himself
on
the
trip
by
overeating
than
by
finding
some
way
to
mismanage
or
damage
the
vehicle
but
if
the
skycar
should
fall
out
of
adjustment
ground
itself
and
signal
for
a
repair
crew
the
repair
crew
is
essential
the
child
cannot
fix
it
himself
the
vanguard
needed
no
repair
crew
save
for
nonessential
ancilliary
machinery
such
as
transbelts
elevators
automassagers
dining
services
and
the
like
such
machinery
which
necessarily
used
moving
parts
had
worn
out
before
the
time
of
the
first
witness
the
useless
mass
involved
had
gone
into
the
auxiliary
converter
or
had
been
adapted
to
other
simpler
purposes
hugh
was
not
even
aware
that
there
ever
had
been
such
machinery
the
stripped
condition
of
most
compartments
was
a
simple
fact
of
nature
to
him
no
cause
for
wonder
hugh
was
aided
in
his
quest
for
understanding
by
two
other
facts
first
spaceship
ballistics
is
a
very
simple
subject
being
hardly
more
than
the
application
of
the
second
law
of
motion
to
an
inverse
square
field
that
statement
runs
contrary
to
our
usual
credos
it
happens
to
be
true
baking
a
cake
calls
for
much
greater
though
subconscious
knowledge
of
engineering
knitting
a
sweater
requires
a
subconscious
understanding
of
much
more
complex
mathematical
relationships
topology
of
a
knitted
garment
but
try
it
yourself
sometime
for
a
complex
subject
consider
neurology
or
catalysts
but
don
t
mention
ballistics
second
the
designers
had
clearly
in
mind
that
the
vanguard
would
reach
her
destination
not
sooner
than
generations
after
her
departure
they
wished
to
make
it
easy
for
the
then
not
yet
born
pilots
who
would
command
her
on
arrival
although
they
anticipated
no
such
hiatus
in
technical
culture
as
took
place
they
did
their
best
to
make
the
controls
simple
and
self
explanatory
the
sophisticated
fourteen
year
old
mentioned
oriented
as
he
would
be
to
the
concept
of
space
would
doubtless
have
figured
them
out
in
a
few
minutes
hugh
reared
in
a
culture
which
believed
that
the
ship
was
the
whole
world
made
no
such
quick
job
of
it
he
was
hampered
by
two
foreign
concepts
distance
and
metrical
time
he
had
to
learn
to
operate
the
finder
a
delayed
action
long
base
parallax
type
designed
for
the
vanguard
and
had
taken
measurements
on
a
couple
of
dozen
stellar
bodies
before
it
occurred
him
that
the
results
he
was
getting
could
possibly
stand
for
anything
the
readings
were
in
parsecs
and
without
meaning
emotionally
the
attempt
with
the
aid
of
the
sacred
to
translate
his
readings
into
linear
units
he
could
stand
resulted
in
figures
which
he
felt
sure
were
were
obviously
preposterous
check
and
recheck
followed
long
periods
of
brooding
forced
him
unwillingly
into
some
dim
comprehension
of
astronomical
magnitudes
the
concepts
frightened
him
and
bewildered
him
for
a
period
of
several
sleeps
he
stayed
away
from
the
control
room
and
gave
way
to
a
feeling
of
futility
and
depression
he
occupied
the
time
in
sorting
over
the
women
captives
it
being
the
first
time
since
his
capture
by
joe
jim
long
ago
that
he
had
had
both
the
opportunity
and
the
mood
to
consider
the
subject
the
candidates
were
numerous
for
in
addition
to
the
usual
crop
of
village
maidens
joe
jim
s
military
operations
had
produced
a
number
of
prime
widows
hugh
availed
himself
of
his
leading
position
in
the
ship
s
new
setup
to
select
two
women
the
first
was
a
widow
a
strong
competent
woman
adept
at
providing
a
man
with
domestic
comforts
he
set
her
up
in
his
new
apartment
high
up
in
low
weight
gave
her
a
free
hand
and
allowed
her
to
retain
her
former
name
of
chloe
the
other
was
a
maiden
untrained
and
wild
as
a
mutie
hugh
could
not
have
told
himself
why
he
picked
her
certainly
she
had
no
virtues
but
she
made
him
feel
funny
she
had
bitten
him
while
he
was
inspecting
her
he
had
slapped
her
naturally
and
that
should
have
been
an
end
to
the
matter
but
he
sent
word
back
later
for
her
father
to
send
her
along
he
had
not
got
around
to
naming
her
metrical
time
caused
him
as
much
mental
confusion
as
astronomical
distances
but
no
emotional
upset
the
trouble
was
again
the
lack
of
the
concept
in
the
ship
the
crew
had
the
notion
of
topological
time
they
understood
now
before
after
has
been
will
be
even
such
notions
as
long
time
and
short
time
but
the
notion
of
measured
time
had
dropped
out
of
the
culture
the
lowest
of
earthbound
cultures
has
some
idea
of
measured
time
even
if
limited
to
days
and
seasons
but
every
earthly
concept
of
measured
time
originates
in
astronomical
phenomena
the
crew
had
been
insulated
from
all
astronomical
phenomena
for
uncounted
generations
hugh
had
before
him
on
the
control
consoles
the
only
working
timepieces
in
the
ship
but
it
was
a
long
long
time
before
he
grasped
what
they
were
for
and
what
bearing
they
had
on
other
instruments
but
until
did
he
could
not
control
the
ship
speed
and
its
derivatives
acceleration
and
flexure
are
based
on
measured
time
but
when
these
two
new
concepts
were
finally
grasped
chewed
over
and
ancient
books
reread
in
the
light
of
these
concepts
he
was
in
a
greatly
restricted
and
theoretical
sense
an
astrogator
hugh
sought
out
joe
jim
to
ask
him
a
question
joe
jim
s
minds
were
brilliantly
penetrating
when
he
cared
to
exert
himself
he
remained
a
superficial
dilettante
because
he
rarely
cared
hugh
found
narby
just
leaving
in
order
to
conduct
the
campaign
of
pacification
of
the
muties
it
had
been
necessary
for
narby
and
joe
jim
to
confer
frequently
to
their
mutual
surprise
they
got
along
well
together
narby
was
a
capable
administrator
able
to
delegate
authority
and
not
given
to
useless
elbow
jogging
joe
jim
surprised
and
pleased
narby
by
being
more
able
than
any
subordinate
he
had
ever
dealt
with
before
there
was
no
love
wasted
between
them
but
each
recognized
in
the
other
both
intelligence
and
a
hard
self
interest
which
matched
his
own
there
was
respect
and
grudging
contemptuous
liking
good
eating
captain
hugh
greeted
narby
formally
oh
hello
hugh
narby
answered
then
turned
back
to
joe
jim
i
ll
expect
a
report
then
you
ll
get
it
joe
agreed
there
can
t
be
more
than
a
few
dozen
stragglers
we
ll
hunt
them
out
or
starve
them
am
i
butting
in
hugh
asked
no
i
m
just
leaving
how
goes
the
great
work
my
dear
fellow
he
smiled
irritatingly
well
enough
but
slowly
do
you
wish
a
report
no
hurry
oh
by
the
bye
i
ve
made
the
control
room
and
main
drive
in
fact
the
entire
level
of
no
weight
taboo
for
everyone
muties
and
crew
alike
so
i
see
your
point
i
guess
there
is
no
need
for
any
but
officers
to
go
up
there
you
don
t
understand
me
it
is
a
general
taboo
applying
to
officers
as
well
not
to
ourselves
of
course
but
but
that
won
t
work
the
only
effective
way
to
convince
the
officers
of
the
truth
is
to
take
them
up
and
show
them
the
stars
that
s
exactly
my
point
i
can
t
have
any
officers
upset
by
disturbing
ideas
while
i
am
consolidating
my
administration
it
will
create
religious
differences
and
impair
discipline
hugh
was
too
upset
and
astounded
to
answer
at
once
but
he
said
at
last
but
that
s
the
point
that
s
why
you
were
made
captain
and
as
captain
i
will
have
to
be
the
final
judge
of
policy
the
matter
is
closed
you
are
not
to
take
anyone
to
the
control
room
nor
any
part
of
no
weight
until
i
deem
it
advisable
you
ll
have
to
wait
it
s
a
good
idea
hugh
jim
commented
we
shouldn
t
stir
things
up
while
we
ve
got
a
war
to
attend
to
let
me
get
this
straight
hugh
persisted
you
mean
this
is
a
temporary
policy
you
could
put
it
that
way
well
all
right
hugh
conceded
but
wait
ertz
and
i
need
to
train
assistants
at
once
very
well
nominate
them
to
me
and
i
ll
pass
on
them
whom
do
you
have
in
mind
hugh
thought
he
did
not
actually
need
assistance
himself
although
the
control
room
contained
acceleration
chairs
for
half
a
dozen
one
man
seated
in
the
chief
astrogator
s
chair
could
pilot
the
ship
the
same
applied
to
ertz
in
the
main
drive
station
save
in
one
respect
how
about
ertz
he
needs
porters
to
move
mass
to
the
main
drive
let
him
i
ll
sign
the
writing
see
that
he
uses
porters
from
the
former
muties
but
no
one
goes
to
the
control
room
save
those
who
have
been
there
before
narby
turned
and
left
with
an
air
of
dismissal
hugh
watched
him
leave
then
said
i
don
t
like
this
joe
jim
why
not
jim
asked
it
s
reasonable
perhaps
it
is
but
well
damn
it
it
seems
to
me
somehow
that
truth
ought
to
be
free
to
anyone
any
time
he
threw
up
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
baffled
exasperation
joe
jim
looked
at
him
oddly
what
a
curious
idea
said
joe
yeah
i
know
it
s
not
common
sense
but
it
seems
like
it
ought
to
be
oh
well
forget
it
that
s
not
what
i
came
to
see
you
about
what
s
on
your
mind
bud
how
do
we
look
we
finish
the
trip
see
we
ve
got
the
ship
touching
a
planet
like
this
he
brought
his
two
fists
together
yes
go
on
well
when
that
s
done
how
do
we
get
out
of
the
ship
the
twins
looked
confused
started
to
argue
between
themselves
finally
joe
interrupted
his
brother
wait
a
bit
jim
let
s
be
logical
about
this
it
was
intended
for
us
to
get
out
that
implies
a
door
doesn
t
it
yeah
sure
there
s
no
door
up
here
it
must
be
down
in
high
weight
but
it
isn
t
objected
hugh
all
that
country
is
known
there
isn
t
any
door
it
has
to
be
up
in
mutie
country
in
that
case
joe
continued
it
should
be
either
all
the
way
forward
or
all
the
way
aft
otherwise
it
would
not
go
anywhere
it
isn
t
aft
there
s
nothing
back
of
main
drive
but
solid
bulkheads
it
would
need
to
be
forward
that
s
silly
jim
commented
there
s
the
control
room
and
the
captain
s
veranda
that
s
all
oh
yeah
how
about
the
locked
compartments
those
aren
t
doors
not
to
the
outside
anyway
just
bulkheads
abaft
the
control
room
no
stupid
but
they
might
lead
to
doors
stupid
eh
even
so
how
are
you
going
to
open
them
answer
me
that
bright
boy
what
demanded
hugh
are
the
locked
compartments
don
t
you
know
there
are
seven
doors
spaced
on
the
main
shaft
in
the
same
bulkhead
as
the
door
to
main
control
room
we
ve
never
been
able
to
open
them
well
maybe
that
s
what
we
re
looking
for
let
s
see
it
s
a
waste
of
time
jim
insisted
but
they
went
bobo
was
taken
along
to
try
his
monstrous
strength
on
the
doors
but
even
his
knotted
swollen
muscles
couldn
t
budge
the
levers
which
appeared
to
be
intended
to
actuate
the
doors
well
jim
sneered
to
his
brother
you
see
joe
shrugged
o
k
you
win
let
s
go
down
wait
a
little
hugh
pleaded
the
second
door
back
the
handle
seemed
to
turn
a
little
let
s
try
it
again
i
m
afraid
it
s
useless
jim
commented
but
joe
said
oh
all
right
as
long
as
we
re
here
bobo
tried
again
wedging
his
shoulder
under
the
lever
and
pushing
from
his
knees
the
lever
gave
suddenly
but
the
door
did
not
open
he
s
broken
it
joe
announced
yeah
hugh
acknowledged
i
guess
that
s
that
he
placed
his
hand
against
the
door
it
swung
open
easily
the
door
did
not
lead
to
outer
space
which
was
well
for
the
three
for
nothing
in
their
experience
warned
them
against
the
peril
of
the
outer
vacuum
instead
a
very
short
and
narrow
vestibule
led
them
to
another
door
which
was
just
barely
ajar
the
door
stuck
on
its
hinges
but
the
fact
that
it
was
slightly
ajar
prevented
it
from
binding
anywhere
else
perhaps
the
last
man
to
use
it
left
it
so
as
a
precaution
against
the
metal
surfaces
freezing
together
but
no
one
would
ever
know
bobo
s
uncouth
strength
opened
it
easily
another
door
lay
six
feet
beyond
i
don
t
understand
this
complained
jim
as
bobo
strained
at
the
third
door
what
s
the
sense
in
an
endless
series
of
doors
wait
and
find
out
advised
his
brother
beyond
the
third
door
lay
not
another
door
but
an
apartment
a
group
of
compartments
odd
ones
small
crowded
together
and
of
unusual
shapes
bobo
shot
on
ahead
and
explored
the
place
knife
in
teeth
his
ugly
body
almost
graceful
in
flight
hugh
and
joe
jim
proceeded
more
slowly
their
eyes
caught
by
the
strangeness
of
the
place
bobo
returned
killed
his
momentum
skillfully
against
a
bulkhead
took
his
blade
from
his
teeth
and
reported
no
door
no
more
door
any
place
bobo
look
there
has
to
be
hugh
insisted
irritated
at
the
dwarf
for
demolishing
his
hopes
the
moron
shrugged
bobo
look
we
ll
look
hugh
and
the
twins
moved
off
in
different
directions
splitting
the
reconnaissance
between
them
hugh
found
no
door
but
what
he
did
find
interested
him
even
more
an
impossibility
he
was
about
to
shout
for
joe
jim
when
he
heard
his
own
name
called
hugh
come
here
reluctantly
he
left
his
discovery
and
sought
out
the
twins
come
see
what
i
ve
found
he
began
nevermind
joe
cut
him
short
look
at
that
hugh
looked
that
was
a
converter
quite
impossibly
but
indubitably
a
converter
it
doesn
t
make
sense
jim
protested
an
apartment
this
size
doesn
t
need
a
converter
that
thing
would
supply
power
and
light
for
half
the
ship
what
do
you
make
of
it
hugh
hugh
examined
it
i
don
t
know
he
admitted
but
if
you
think
this
is
strange
come
see
what
i
ve
found
what
have
you
found
come
see
the
twins
followed
him
and
saw
a
small
compartment
one
wall
of
which
appeared
to
be
of
glass
black
as
if
the
far
side
were
obscured
facing
the
wall
were
two
acceleratlon
chairs
side
by
side
the
arms
and
the
lap
desks
of
the
chairs
were
covered
with
patterns
of
little
white
lights
of
the
same
sort
as
the
control
lights
on
the
chairs
in
the
main
control
room
joe
jim
made
no
comment
at
first
save
for
a
low
whistle
from
jim
he
sat
down
in
one
of
the
chairs
and
started
experimenting
cautiously
with
the
controls
hugh
sat
down
beside
him
joe
jim
covered
a
group
of
white
lights
on
the
right
hand
arm
of
his
chair
the
lights
in
the
compartment
went
out
when
he
lifted
his
hand
the
tiny
control
lights
were
blue
instead
of
white
neither
joe
jim
nor
hugh
was
startled
when
the
lights
went
out
they
had
expected
it
for
the
control
involved
corresponded
to
similar
controls
in
the
control
room
joe
jim
fumbled
around
trying
to
find
controls
which
would
produce
a
simulacrum
of
the
heavens
on
the
blank
glass
before
him
there
were
no
such
controls
and
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
glass
was
an
actual
view
port
obscured
by
the
hull
of
the
ship
proper
rather
than
a
view
screen
but
he
did
manage
to
actuate
the
controls
that
occupied
the
corresponding
position
these
controls
were
labeled
launching
joe
jim
had
disregarded
the
label
because
he
did
not
understand
it
actuating
them
produced
no
very
remarkable
results
except
that
a
red
light
blinked
rapidly
and
a
transparency
below
the
label
came
into
life
it
read
air
lock
open
which
was
very
lucky
for
joe
jim
hugh
and
bobo
had
they
closed
the
doors
behind
them
and
had
the
little
converter
contained
even
a
few
grams
of
mass
available
for
power
they
would
have
found
themselves
launched
suddenly
into
space
in
a
ship
s
boat
unequipped
for
a
trip
and
whose
controls
they
understood
only
by
analogy
with
those
in
the
control
room
perhaps
they
could
have
maneuvered
the
boat
back
into
its
cradle
more
likely
they
would
have
crashed
attempting
it
but
hugh
and
joe
jim
were
not
yet
aware
that
the
apartment
they
had
entered
was
a
spacecraft
the
idea
of
a
ship
s
boat
was
still
foreign
to
them
turn
on
the
lights
hugh
requested
joe
jim
did
so
well
hugh
went
on
what
do
you
make
of
it
it
seems
pretty
obvious
answered
jim
this
is
another
control
room
we
didn
t
guess
it
was
here
because
we
couldn
t
open
the
door
that
doesn
t
make
sense
joe
objected
why
should
there
be
two
control
rooms
for
one
ship
why
should
a
man
have
two
heads
his
brother
reasoned
from
my
point
of
view
you
are
obviously
a
supernumerary
it
s
not
the
same
thing
we
were
born
that
way
but
this
didn
t
just
happen
the
ship
was
built
so
what
jim
argued
we
carry
two
knives
don
t
we
and
we
weren
t
born
with
em
it
s
a
good
idea
to
have
a
spare
but
you
can
t
control
the
ship
from
here
joe
protested
you
can
t
see
anything
from
here
if
you
wanted
a
second
set
of
controls
the
place
to
put
them
would
be
the
captain
s
veranda
where
you
can
see
the
stars
how
about
that
jim
asked
indicating
the
wall
of
glass
use
your
head
his
brother
advised
it
faces
the
wrong
direction
it
looks
into
the
ship
not
out
and
it
s
not
an
arrangement
like
the
control
room
there
isn
t
any
way
to
mirror
the
stars
on
it
maybe
we
haven
t
located
the
controls
for
it
even
so
you
ve
forgotten
something
how
about
that
little
converter
what
about
it
it
must
have
some
significance
it
s
not
here
by
accident
i
ll
bet
you
that
these
controls
have
something
to
do
with
that
converter
why
why
not
why
are
they
here
together
if
there
isn
t
some
connection
hugh
broke
his
puzzled
silence
everythmg
the
twins
had
said
seemed
to
make
sense
even
the
contradictions
it
was
all
very
confusing
but
the
converter
the
little
conver
say
look
he
burst
out
look
at
what
do
you
suppose
do
you
think
that
maybe
this
part
of
the
ship
could
move
naturally
the
whole
ship
moves
no
said
hugh
no
no
i
don
t
mean
that
at
all
suppose
it
moved
by
itself
these
controls
and
the
little
converter
suppose
it
could
move
right
away
from
the
ship
that
s
pretty
fantastic
maybe
so
but
if
it
s
true
this
is
the
way
out
huh
said
joe
nonsense
no
door
to
the
outside
here
either
but
there
would
be
if
this
apartment
were
moved
away
from
the
ship
the
way
we
came
in
the
two
heads
snapped
simultaneously
toward
him
as
if
jerked
by
the
same
string
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
fell
to
arguing
joe
jim
repeated
his
experiment
witit
the
controls
see
joe
pointed
out
launching
it
means
to
start
something
to
push
something
away
then
why
doesn
t
it
air
lock
open
the
doors
we
came
through
it
has
to
be
that
everything
else
is
closed
let
s
try
it
we
would
have
to
start
the
converter
first
o
k
not
so
fast
get
out
and
maybe
you
can
t
come
back
we
d
starve
hm
m
m
we
ll
wait
a
while
hugh
listened
to
the
discussion
while
snooping
around
the
control
panels
trying
to
figure
them
out
there
was
a
stowage
space
under
the
lap
desk
of
his
chair
he
fished
into
it
encountered
something
and
hauled
it
out

what

joe

1
october
approximately
2172
i
theodor
mawson
formerly
storekeeper
ordinary
have
been
selected
this
date
as
captain
of
the
vanguard
since
the
last
entry
in
this
log
there
have
been
enormous
changes
the
mutiny
has
been
suppressed
or
more
properly
has
died
out
but
with
tragic
cost
every
pilot
officer
every
navigation
officer
is
dead
or
believed
to
be
dead
i
would
not
have
been
chosen
captain
had
there
been
a
qualified
man
left
approximately
ninety
per
cent
of
the
personnel
are
dead
not
all
of
that
number
died
in
the
original
outbreak
no
crops
have
been
planted
since
the
mutiny
our
food
stocks
are
low
there
seems
to
be
clear
evidence
of
cannibalism
among
the
mutineers
who
have
not
surrendered
my
immediate
task
must
be
to
restore
some
semblance
of
order
and
discipline
among
the
crew
crops
must
be
planted
a
regular
watch
must
be
instituted
at
the
auxiliary
converter
on
which
we
are
dependent
for
heat
and
light
and
power
the
next
entry
was
undated
i
have
been
far
too
busy
to
keep
this
log
up
properly
truthfully
i
do
not
know
the
date
even
approximately
the
ship
s
clocks
no
longer
run
that
may
be
attributable
to
the
erratic
operation
of
the
auxiliary
converter
or
it
may
possibly
be
an
effect
of
radiations
from
outer
space
we
no
longer
have
an
antiradiation
shield
around
the
ship
since
the
main
converter
is
not
in
operation
my
chief
engineer
assures
me
that
the
main
converter
could
be
started
but
we
have
no
one
fitted
to
astrogate
i
have
tried
to
teach
myself
astrogation
from
the
books
at
hand
but
the
mathematics
involved
are
very
difficult
about
one
newborn
child
out
of
twenty
is
deformed
i
have
instituted
a
spartan
code
such
children
are
not
permitted
to
live
it
is
harsh
but
necessary
i
am
growing
very
old
and
feeble
and
must
consider
the
selection
of
my
successor
i
am
the
last
member
of
the
crew
to
be
born
on
earth
and
even
i
have
little
recollection
of
it
i
was
five
when
my
parents
embarked
i
do
not
know
my
own
age
but
certain
unmistakable
signs
tell
me
that
the
time
is
not
far
away
when
i
too
must
make
the
trip
to
the
converter
there
has
been
a
curious
change
in
orientation
in
my
people
never
having
lived
on
a
planet
it
becomes
more
difficult
as
time
passes
for
them
to
comprehend
anything
not
connected
with
the
ship
i
have
ceased
trying
to
talk
to
them
about
it
it
is
hardly
a
kindness
anyhow
as
i
have
no
hope
of
leading
them
out
of
the
darkness
theirs
is
a
hard
life
at
best
they
strive
for
a
crop
only
to
have
it
raided
by
the
outlaws
who
still
flourish
on
the
upper
levels
why
speak
to
them
of
better
things
rather
than
pass
this
on
to
my
successor
i
have
decided
to
attempt
to
hide
it
if
possible
in
the
single
ship
s
boat
left
by
the
mutineers
who
escaped
it
will
be
safe
there
a
long
time
otherwise
some
witless
fool
may
decide
to
use
it
for
fuel
for
the
converter
i
caught
the
man
on
watch
feeding
it
with
the
last
of
a
set
of
encyclopaedia
terresriana
priceless
books
the
idiot
had
never
been
taught
to
read
some
rule
must
be
instituted
concerning
books
this
is
my
last
entry
i
have
put
off
making
the
attempt
to
place
this
log
in
safekeeping
because
it
is
very
perilous
to
ascend
above
the
lower
decks
but
my
life
is
no
longer
valuable
i
wish
to
die
knowing
that
a
true
record
is
left
theodor
mawson
captain
even
the
twins
were
silent
for
a
long
time
after
hugh
stopped
reading
at
last
joe
heaved
a
long
sigh
and
said
so
that
s
how
it
happened
the
poor
guy
hugh
said
softly
who
captain
mawson
why
so
no
not
captain
mawson
that
other
guy
pilot
officer
baldwin
think
of
him
going
out
through
that
door
with
huff
on
the
other
side
hugh
shivered
in
spite
of
his
enlightenment
he
subconsciously
envisioned
huff
huff
the
accursed
first
to
sin
as
about
twice
as
high
as
joe
jim
twice
as
strong
as
bobo
and
having
fangs
rather
than
teeth
hugh
borrowed
a
couple
of
porters
from
ertz
porters
whom
ertz
was
using
to
fetch
the
pickled
bodies
of
the
war
casualties
to
the
main
converter
for
fuel
and
used
them
to
provision
the
ship
s
boat
water
breadstuffs
preserved
meats
mass
for
the
converter
he
did
not
report
the
matter
to
narby
nor
did
he
report
the
discovery
of
the
boat
itself
he
had
no
conscious
reason
narby
irritated
him
the
star
of
their
destination
grew
and
grew
swelled
until
it
showed
a
visible
disc
and
was
too
bright
to
be
stared
at
long
its
bearing
changed
rapidly
for
a
star
it
pulled
across
the
backdrop
of
the
stellariwn
dome
left
uncontrolled
the
ship
would
have
swung
part
way
around
it
in
a
wide
hyperbolic
arc
accelerated
as
it
flipped
around
the
star
then
sped
off
again
into
the
darkness
it
took
hugh
the
equivalent
of
many
weeks
to
calculate
the
elements
of
the
trajectory
it
took
still
longer
for
ertz
and
joe
jim
to
check
his
figures
and
satisfy
themselves
that
the
preposterous
answers
were
right
it
took
even
longer
to
convince
ertz
that
the
way
to
rendezvous
in
space
was
to
apply
a
force
that
pushed
one
away
from
where
one
wished
to
go
that
is
to
say
dig
in
the
heels
put
on
the
brakes
kill
the
momentum
in
fact
it
took
a
series
of
experiments
in
free
flight
on
the
level
of
weightlessness
to
sell
him
the
idea
otherwise
he
would
have
favored
finishing
the
trip
by
the
simple
expedient
of
crashing
headlong
into
the
star
at
top
speed
thereafter
hugh
and
joe
jim
calculated
how
to
apply
acceleration
to
kill
the
speed
of
the
vanguard
and
warp
her
into
an
eccentric
ellipse
around
the
star
after
that
they
would
search
for
planets
ertz
bad
a
little
trouble
understanding
the
difference
between
a
planet
and
a
star
alan
never
did
get
it
if
my
numbering
is
correct
hugh
informed
ertz
we
should
start
accelerating
any
time
now
o
k
ertz
told
him
main
drive
is
ready
over
two
hundred
bodies
and
a
lot
of
waste
mass
what
are
waiting
for
let
s
see
narby
and
get
permission
to
start
why
ask
him
hugh
shrugged
he
s
captain
he
ll
want
to
know
all
right
let
s
pick
up
joe
jim
and
get
on
with
it
they
left
hugh
s
apartment
and
went
to
joe
jim
s
joe
jim
was
not
there
but
they
found
alan
looking
for
him
too
squatty
says
he
s
gone
down
to
the
captain
s
office
alan
informed
him
so
it
s
just
as
well
we
ll
see
him
there
alan
old
boy
you
know
what
what
the
time
has
arrived
we
re
going
to
do
it
start
moving
the
ship
alan
looked
round
eyed
gee
right
now
just
as
soon
as
we
can
notify
the
captain
come
along
if
you
like
you
bet
wait
while
i
tell
my
woman
he
darted
away
to
his
own
quarters
nearby
he
pampers
that
wench
remarked
ertz
sometimes
you
can
t
help
it
said
hugh
with
a
faraway
look
alan
returned
promptly
although
it
was
evident
that
he
had
taken
time
to
change
to
a
fresh
breechcloth
o
k
he
bubbled
let
s
go
alan
approached
the
captain
s
office
with
a
proud
step
he
was
an
important
guy
now
he
exulted
to
himself
he
d
march
on
through
with
his
friends
while
the
guards
saluted
no
more
of
this
business
of
being
pushed
around
but
the
doorkeeper
did
not
stand
aside
although
he
did
salute
while
placing
himself
so
that
he
filled
the
door
gangway
man
ertz
said
gruffly
yes
sir
acknowledged
the
guard
without
moving
your
weapons
please
what
don
t
you
know
me
you
idiot
i
m
the
chief
engineer
yes
sir
leave
your
weapons
with
me
please
regulations
ertz
put
a
hand
on
the
man
s
shoulder
and
shoved
the
guard
stood
firm
i
m
sorry
sir
no
one
approaches
the
captain
wearing
weapons
no
one
well
i
ll
be
damned
he
remembers
what
happened
to
the
old
captain
hugh
observed
sotto
voce
he
s
smart
he
drew
his
own
knife
and
tossed
it
to
the
guard
who
caught
it
neatly
by
the
hilt
ertz
looked
shrugged
and
handed
over
his
own
alan
considerably
crestfallen
passed
his
own
pair
over
with
a
look
that
should
have
shortened
the
guard
s
life
narby
was
talking
joe
jim
was
scowling
on
both
his
faces
bobo
looked
puzzled
and
naked
unfinished
without
his
ubiquitous
knives
and
slingshot
the
matter
is
closed
joe
jim
that
is
my
decision
i
ve
granted
you
the
faver
of
explaining
my
reasons
but
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
like
them
or
not
what
s
the
trouble
inquired
hugh
narby
looked
up
oh
i
m
glad
you
came
in
your
mutie
friend
seems
to
be
in
doubt
as
to
who
is
captain
what
s
up
he
growled
jim
hooking
a
thumb
toward
narby
seems
to
think
he
s
going
to
disarm
all
the
muties
well
the
war
s
over
isn
t
it
it
wasn
t
agreed
on
the
muties
were
to
become
part
of
the
crew
take
the
knives
away
from
the
muties
and
the
crew
will
kill
them
off
in
no
time
it
s
not
fair
the
crew
have
knives
the
time
will
come
when
they
won
t
narby
predicted
but
i
ll
do
it
at
my
own
time
in
my
own
way
this
is
the
first
step
what
did
you
want
to
see
me
about
ertz
ask
hugh
narby
turned
to
hugh
i
ve
come
to
notify
you
captain
narby
hugh
stated
formally
that
we
are
about
to
start
the
main
converter
and
move
the
ship
narby
looked
surprised
but
not
disconcerted
i
m
afraid
you
will
have
to
postpone
that
i
am
not
yet
ready
to
permit
officers
to
go
up
to
no
weight
it
won
t
be
necessary
hugh
explained
ertz
and
i
can
handle
the
first
maneuvers
alone
but
we
can
t
wait
if
the
ship
is
not
moved
at
once
the
trip
won
t
be
in
your
lifetime
nor
mine
then
it
must
narby
replied
evenly
wait
what
cried
hugh
narby
don
t
you
want
to
the
trip
i
m
in
no
hurry
what
sort
of
damn
foolishness
is
this
ertz
demanded
what
s
got
into
you
fin
of
course
we
move
the
ship
narby
drummed
on
his
desk
top
before
replying
then
he
said
since
there
seems
to
be
some
slight
misunderstanding
as
to
who
gives
orders
around
here
i
might
as
well
let
you
have
it
straight
hoyland
as
long
as
your
pastimes
did
not
interfere
with
the
administration
of
tbe
ship
i
was
willing
for
you
to
amuse
yourself
i
granted
that
willingly
for
you
have
been
very
useful
in
your
own
way
but
when
your
crazy
beliefs
become
a
possible
source
of
corruption
to
good
morals
and
a
danger
to
the
peace
and
security
of
the
ship
i
have
to
crack
down
hugh
had
opened
and
closed
his
mouth
several
times
during
this
speech
finally
he
managed
to
get
out
crazy
did
you
say
crazy
yes
i
did
for
a
man
to
believe
that
the
solid
ship
can
move
means
that
he
is
either
crazy
or
an
ignorant
religious
fanatic
since
both
of
you
have
the
advantage
of
a
scientist
s
training
i
assume
that
you
have
lost
your
minds
good
jordan
said
hugh
the
man
has
seen
with
his
own
eyes
he
s
seen
the
immortal
stars
yet
he
sits
there
and
calls
us
crazy
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
narby
ertz
inquired
coldly
why
the
razzle
dazzle
you
aren
t
kidding
anyone
you
ve
been
to
the
control
room
you
ve
been
to
the
captain
s
veranda
you
know
the
ship
moves
you
interest
me
ertz
commented
narby
looking
him
over
i
ve
wondered
whether
you
were
playing
up
to
hoyland
s
delusions
or
were
deluded
yourself
now
i
see
that
you
are
crazy
too
ertz
kept
his
temper
explain
yourself
you
ve
seen
the
control
room
how
can
you
contend
that
the
ship
does
not
move
narby
smiled
i
thought
you
were
a
better
engineer
than
you
appear
to
be
ertz
the
control
room
is
an
enormous
hoax
you
know
yourself
that
those
lights
are
turned
on
and
off
by
switches
a
very
clever
piece
of
engineering
my
theory
is
that
it
was
used
to
strike
awe
in
the
minds
of
the
superstitious
and
make
them
believe
in
the
ancient
myths
but
we
don
t
need
it
any
more
the
crew
believe
without
it
it
s
a
source
of
distraction
now
i
m
going
to
have
it
destroyed
and
the
door
sealed
up
hugh
went
all
to
pieces
at
this
sputtered
incoherently
and
would
have
grappled
with
narby
had
not
ertz
restrained
him
easy
hugh
he
admonished
joe
jim
took
hugh
by
the
arm
his
own
faces
stony
masks
ertz
went
on
quietly
suppose
what
you
say
is
true
suppose
that
the
main
converter
and
the
main
drive
itself
are
nothing
but
dummies
and
that
we
can
never
start
them
what
about
the
captain
s
veranda
you
ve
seen
the
stars
there
not
just
an
engineered
shadow
show
narby
laughed
ertz
you
are
stupider
than
i
ve
guessed
i
admit
that
the
display
in
the
veranda
had
me
mystified
at
first
not
that
i
ever
believed
in
it
then
the
control
room
gave
the
clue
it
s
an
illusion
a
piece
of
skillful
engineering
behind
that
glass
is
another
compartment
about
the
same
size
and
unlighted
against
its
darkness
those
tiny
moving
lights
give
the
effect
of
a
bottomless
hole
it
s
essentially
the
same
trick
as
they
used
in
the
control
room
it
s
obvious
he
went
on
i
m
surprised
that
you
did
not
see
it
when
an
apparent
fact
runs
contrary
to
logic
and
common
sense
it
s
obvious
that
you
have
failed
to
interpret
the
fact
correctly
the
most
obvious
fact
of
nature
is
the
reality
of
the
ship
itself
solid
immutable
complete
any
so
called
fact
which
appears
to
disprove
that
is
bound
to
be
an
illusion
knowing
that
i
looked
for
the
trick
behind
the
illusion
and
found
it
wait
said
ertz
do
you
mean
that
you
have
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
in
the
captain
s
veranda
and
seen
these
trick
lights
you
talk
about
no
admitted
narby
it
wasn
t
necessary
not
that
it
wouldn
t
be
easy
enough
to
do
so
but
it
isn
t
necessary
i
don
t
have
to
cut
myself
to
know
that
knives
are
sharp
so
ertz
paused
and
thought
a
moment
i
ll
strike
a
deal
with
you
if
hugh
and
i
are
crazy
in
our
beliefs
no
harm
is
done
as
long
as
we
keep
our
mouths
shut
we
try
to
move
the
ship
if
we
fail
we
re
wrong
and
you
re
right
the
captain
does
not
bargain
narby
pointed
out
however
i
ll
consider
it
that
s
all
you
may
go
ertz
turned
to
go
unsatisfied
but
checked
for
moment
he
caught
sight
of
joe
jim
s
faces
and
turned
back
one
more
thing
he
said
what
s
this
about
the
muties
why
are
you
shoving
joe
jim
around
he
and
his
boys
made
you
captain
you
ve
got
to
fair
about
this
narby
s
smiling
superiority
cracked
for
amoment
don
t
interfere
ertz
groups
of
armed
savages
are
not
going
to
threaten
this
ship
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
the
prisoners
jim
stated
but
my
own
gang
keep
their
knives
they
were
promised
good
eating
forever
if
they
fought
for
you
they
keep
their
knives
and
that
s
flnal
narby
looked
him
up
and
down
joe
jim
he
remarked
i
have
long
believed
that
the
only
good
mutie
was
a
dead
mutie
you
do
much
to
confirm
my
opinion
it
will
interest
you
to
know
that
by
this
time
your
gang
is
already
disarmed
and
dead
in
the
bargain
that
s
why
i
sent
for
you
the
guards
piled
in
whether
by
signal
or
previous
arrangement
it
was
impossible
to
say
caught
flatfooted
naked
weaponless
the
five
found
themselves
each
with
an
armed
man
at
his
back
before
they
could
rally
take
them
away
ordered
narby
bobo
whined
and
looked
to
joe
jim
for
guidance
joe
caught
his
eye
up
bobo
the
dwarf
jumped
straight
for
joe
jim
s
captor
careless
of
the
knife
at
his
back
forced
to
split
his
attention
the
man
lost
a
vital
half
second
joe
jim
kicked
him
in
the
stomach
and
appropriated
his
blade
hugh
was
on
the
deck
deadlocked
with
his
man
his
fist
clutched
around
the
knife
wrist
joe
jim
thrust
and
the
struggle
ceased
the
two
headed
man
looked
around
saw
a
mixed
pile
up
of
four
bodies
ertz
alan
two
others
joe
jim
used
his
knife
judiciously
being
careful
to
match
the
faces
with
the
bodies
presently
his
men
emerged
get
their
knives
he
ordered
superfluously
his
words
were
drowned
by
a
high
agonized
scream
bobo
still
without
a
knife
had
resorted
to
his
primal
weapons
his
late
captor
s
face
was
a
bloody
mess
half
bitten
away
get
his
knife
said
joe
can
t
reach
it
bobo
admitted
guiltily
the
reason
was
evident
the
hilt
protruded
from
bobo
s
ribs
just
below
his
right
shoulder
blade
joe
jim
examined
it
touched
it
gently
it
was
stuck
can
you
walk
sure
grunted
bobo
and
grimaced
let
it
stay
where
it
is
alan
with
me
hugh
and
bill
cover
rear
bobo
in
the
middle
where
s
narby
demanded
ertz
dabbing
at
a
round
on
his
cheekbone
but
narby
was
gone
ducked
out
through
the
rear
door
behind
his
desk
and
it
was
locked
clerks
scattered
before
them
in
the
outer
office
joe
jim
knifed
the
guard
at
the
outer
door
while
he
was
still
raising
his
whistle
hastily
they
retrieved
their
own
weapons
and
added
them
to
those
they
had
seized
they
fled
upward
two
decks
above
inhabited
levels
bobo
stumbled
and
fell
joe
jim
picked
him
up
can
you
make
it
the
dwarf
nodded
dumbly
blood
on
his
lips
they
climbed
twenty
decks
or
so
higher
it
became
evident
that
bobo
could
no
longer
climb
though
they
had
taken
turns
in
boosting
him
from
the
rear
but
weight
was
lessened
appreciably
at
that
level
alan
braced
himself
and
picked
up
the
solid
form
as
if
it
were
a
child
they
climbed
joe
jim
relieved
alan
they
climbed
ertz
relieved
joe
jim
hugh
relieved
ertz
they
reached
the
level
on
which
they
lived
forward
of
their
group
apartments
hugh
turned
in
that
direction
put
him
down
commanded
joe
where
do
you
think
you
are
going
hugh
settled
the
wounded
man
to
the
deck
homes
where
else
fool
that
s
where
they
will
look
for
us
first
where
do
we
go
nowhere
in
the
ship
we
go
out
of
the
ship
huh
the
ship
s
boat
he
s
right
agreed
ertz
the
whole
ship
s
against
us
now
but
but
hugh
surrendered
it
s
a
long
chance
but
we
ll
try
it
he
started
again
in
the
direction
of
their
homes
hey
shouted
jim
not
that
way
we
have
to
get
our
women
to
huff
with
the
women
you
ll
get
caught
there
s
no
time
but
ertz
and
alan
started
off
without
question
oh
all
right
jim
snorted
but
hurry
i
ll
stay
with
bobo
joe
jim
turned
his
attention
to
the
dwarf
gently
rolled
him
to
his
side
and
made
a
careful
examination
his
skin
was
gray
and
damp
a
long
red
stain
ran
down
from
his
right
shoulder
bobo
sighed
bubblingly
and
rubbed
his
head
against
joe
jim
s
thigh
bobo
tired
boss
joe
jim
patted
his
head
easy
said
jim
this
is
going
to
hurt
lifting
the
wounded
man
slightly
he
cautiously
worked
the
blade
loose
and
withdrew
it
from
the
wound
blood
poured
out
freely
joe
jim
examined
the
knife
noted
the
deadly
length
of
steel
and
measured
it
against
the
wound
he
ll
never
make
it
whispered
joe
jim
caught
his
eye
well
joe
nodded
slowly
joe
jim
tried
the
blade
he
had
just
extracted
from
the
wound
against
his
own
thigh
and
discarded
it
in
favor
of
one
of
his
own
razor
edged
tools
he
took
the
dwarf
s
chin
in
his
left
hand
and
joe
commanded
look
at
me
bobo
bobo
looked
up
answered
inaudibly
joe
held
his
eye
good
bobo
strong
bobo
the
dwarf
grinned
as
if
he
heard
and
understood
but
made
no
attempt
to
reply
his
master
pulled
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
the
blade
bit
deep
snicking
the
jugular
vein
without
touching
the
windpipe
good
bobo
joe
repeated
bobo
grinned
again
when
the
eyes
were
glassy
and
breathing
had
unquestionably
stopped
joe
jim
stood
up
letting
the
head
and
shoulders
roll
from
him
he
shoved
the
body
with
his
foot
to
the
side
of
the
passage
and
stared
down
the
direction
in
which
the
others
had
gone
they
should
be
back
by
now
he
stuck
the
salvaged
blade
in
his
belt
and
made
sure
that
all
his
weapons
were
loose
and
ready
they
arrived
on
a
dead
run
a
little
trouble
hugh
explained
breathlessly
squatty
s
dead
no
more
of
your
men
around
dead
maybe
narby
probably
meant
it
here
he
handed
him
a
long
knife
and
the
body
armor
that
had
been
built
for
joe
jim
with
its
great
wide
cage
of
steel
fit
to
cover
two
heads
ertz
and
alan
wore
armor
as
did
hugh
the
women
did
not
none
had
been
built
for
them
joe
jim
noted
that
hugh
s
younger
wife
bore
a
fresh
swelling
on
her
lip
as
if
someone
had
persuaded
her
with
a
heavy
hand
her
eyes
were
stormy
though
her
manner
was
docile
the
older
wife
chloe
seemed
to
take
the
events
in
her
stride
ertz
s
was
crying
softly
alan
s
wench
reflected
the
bewilderment
of
her
master
how
s
bobo
hugh
inquired
as
he
settled
joe
jim
s
armor
in
place
made
the
trip
joe
informed
him
so
well
that
s
that
let
s
go
they
stopped
short
of
the
level
of
no
weight
and
worked
forward
because
the
women
were
not
adept
at
weightless
flying
when
they
reached
the
bulkhead
which
separated
the
control
room
and
boat
pockets
from
the
body
of
the
ship
they
went
up
there
was
neither
alarm
nor
ambush
although
joe
thought
that
he
saw
a
head
show
as
they
reached
one
deck
he
mentioned
it
to
his
brother
but
not
to
the
others
the
door
to
the
boat
pocket
stuck
and
bobo
was
not
there
to
free
it
the
men
tried
it
in
succession
sweating
big
with
the
strain
joe
jim
tried
it
a
second
time
joe
relaxing
and
letting
jim
control
their
muscles
that
they
might
not
fight
each
other
the
door
gave
get
them
inside
snapped
jim
and
fast
joe
confirmed
they
re
on
us
he
had
kept
lookout
while
his
brother
strove
a
shout
from
down
the
line
reinforced
his
warning
the
twins
faced
around
to
meet
the
threat
while
the
men
shoved
the
women
in
alan
s
fuzzy
headed
mate
chose
that
moment
to
go
to
pieces
squalled
and
tried
to
run
but
weightlessness
defeated
her
hugh
nabbed
her
shoved
her
inside
and
booted
her
heartily
with
his
foot
joe
jim
let
a
blade
go
at
long
throwing
range
to
slow
down
the
advance
it
accomplished
its
purpose
their
opponents
half
a
dozen
of
them
checked
their
advance
then
apparently
on
signal
six
knives
cut
the
air
simultaneonsly
jim
felt
something
strike
him
felt
no
pain
and
concluded
that
the
armor
had
saved
him
missed
us
joe
he
exulted
there
was
no
answer
jim
turned
his
bead
tried
to
look
at
his
brother
a
few
inches
from
his
eye
a
knife
stuck
through
the
bars
of
the
helmet
its
point
was
buried
deep
inside
his
left
eye
his
brother
was
dead
hugh
stuck
his
head
back
out
of
the
door
come
on
joe
jim
he
shouted
we
re
all
in
get
inside
ordered
jim
close
the
door
but
get
inside
jim
turned
and
shoved
him
in
the
face
closing
the
door
as
he
did
so
hugh
had
one
startled
glimpse
of
the
knife
and
the
sagging
lifeless
face
it
pinned
then
the
door
closed
against
him
and
he
heard
the
lever
turn
jim
turned
back
at
the
attackers
shoving
himself
away
from
the
bulkhead
with
legs
which
were
curiously
heavy
he
plunged
toward
them
his
great
arm
long
knife
more
a
bob
than
a
sword
grasped
with
both
hands
knives
sang
toward
him
clattered
against
his
breastplate
bit
into
his
legs
he
swung
a
wide
awkward
two
handed
stroke
which
gutted
an
opponent
nearly
cutting
him
in
two
that
s
for
joe
the
blow
stopped
him
he
turned
in
the
air
steadied
himself
and
swung
again
that
s
for
bobo
they
closed
on
him
he
swung
widely
caring
not
where
he
hit
as
long
as
his
blade
met
resistance
and
that
s
for
me
a
knife
planted
itself
in
his
thigh
it
did
not
even
slow
him
up
legs
were
dispensable
in
no
weight
one
for
all
a
man
was
on
his
back
now
he
could
feel
him
no
matter
here
was
one
before
him
too
one
who
could
feel
steel
as
be
swung
he
shouted
all
for
o
the
words
trailed
off
but
the
stroke
was
finished
hugh
tried
to
open
the
door
which
had
been
slammed
in
his
face
he
was
unable
to
do
so
if
there
were
means
provided
to
do
so
he
was
unable
to
figure
them
out
he
pressed
an
ear
against
the
steel
and
listened
but
the
airtight
door
gave
back
no
clue
ertz
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
come
on
be
said
where
s
joe
jim
he
stayed
behind
open
up
the
door
get
him
i
can
t
it
won
t
open
he
meant
to
stay
he
closed
it
himself
but
we
ve
got
to
get
him
we
re
blood
sworn
i
think
said
hugh
with
a
sudden
flash
of
insight
that
s
why
he
stayed
behind
he
told
ertz
what
he
had
seen
anyhow
he
concluded
it
s
the
end
of
the
trip
to
him
get
on
back
and
feed
mass
to
that
converter
i
want
power
they
entered

he
called
out
we
re
going
to
start
keep
those
damned
women
out
of
the
way
he
settled
himself
in
the
pilot
s
chair
and
cut
the
lights
in
the
darkness
he
covered
a
pattern
of
green
lights
a
transparency
flashed
on
the
lap
desk
drive
ready
ertz
was
on
the
job
here
goes
he
thought
and
actuated
the
launching
combination
there
was
a
short
pause
a
short
and
sickening
lurch
a
twist
it
frightened
him
since
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
launching
tracks
were
pitched
to
offset
the
normal
spinning
of
the
ship
the
glass
of
the
view
port
before
him
was
speckled
with
stars
they
were
free
moving
but
the
spread
of
jeweled
lights
was
not
unbroken
as
it
invariably
had
been
when
seen
from
the
veranda
or
seen
mirrored
on
the
control
room
walls
a
great
gross
ungainly
shape
gleamed
softly
under
the
light
of
the
star
whose
system
they
had
entered
at
first
he
could
not
account
for
it
then
with
a
rush
of
superstitious
awe
he
realized
that
he
was
looking
at
the
ship
itself
the
true
ship
seen
from
the
outside
in
spite
of
his
long
intellectual
awareness
of
the
true
nature
of
the
ship
he
had
never
visualized
looking
at
it
the
stars
yes
the
surface
of
a
planet
he
had
struggled
with
that
concept
but
the
outer
surface
of
the
ship
no
when
he
did
see
it
it
shocked
him
alan
touched
him
hugh
what
is
it
hoyland
tried
to
explain
to
him
alan
shook
his
head
and
blinked
his
eyes
i
don
t
get
it
never
mind
bring
ertz
up
here
fetch
the
women
too
we
ll
let
them
see
it
all
right
but
he
added
with
sound
intuition
it
s
a
mistake
to
show
the
women
you
ll
scare
em
silly
they
ain
t
even
seen
the
stars
luck
sound
engineering
design
and
a
little
knowledge
good
design
ten
times
that
much
luck
and
a
precious
little
knowledge
it
was
luck
that
had
placed
the
ship
near
a
star
with
a
planetary
system
luck
that
the
ship
arrived
there
with
a
speed
low
enough
for
hugh
to
counteract
it
in
a
ship
s
auxiliary
craft
luck
that
he
learned
to
handle
it
after
a
fashion
before
they
starved
or
lost
themselves
in
deep
space
it
was
good
design
that
provided
the
little
craft
with
a
great
reserve
of
power
and
speed
the
designers
had
anticipated
that
the
pioneers
might
need
to
explore
the
far
flung
planets
of
a
solar
system
they
had
provided
for
it
in
the
planning
of
the
ship
s
boats
with
a
large
factor
of
safety
hugh
strained
that
factor
to
the
limit
it
was
luck
that
placed
them
near
the
plane
of
planetary
motion
luck
that
when
hugh
did
manage
to
gun
the
tiny
projectile
into
a
closed
orbit
the
orbit
agreed
in
direction
with
the
rotation
of
the
planets
luck
that
the
eccentric
ellipse
he
achieved
should
cause
them
to
crawl
up
on
a
giant
planet
so
that
he
was
eventually
able
to
identify
it
as
such
by
sight
for
otherwise
they
might
have
spun
around
that
star
until
they
all
died
of
old
age
ignoring
for
the
moment
the
readier
hazards
of
hunger
and
thirst
without
ever
coming
close
enough
to
a
planet
to
pick
it
out
from
the
stars
there
is
a
misconception
geocentric
and
anthropomorphic
common
to
the
large
majority
of
the
earth
bound
which
causes
them
to
visualize
a
planetary
system
stereoscopically
the
mind
s
eye
sees
a
sun
remote
from
a
backdrop
of
stars
and
surrounded
by
spinning
apples
the
planets
step
out
on
your
balcony
and
look
can
you
tell
the
planets
from
the
stars
venus
you
may
pick
out
with
ease
but
could
you
tell
it
from
canopus
if
you
had
not
previously
been
introduced
that
little
red
speck
is
it
mars
or
is
it
antares
how
would
you
know
if
you
were
as
ignorant
as
hugh
hoyland
blast
for
antares
believing
it
to
be
a
planet
and
you
will
never
live
to
have
grandchildren
the
great
planet
that
they
crawled
up
on
till
it
showed
a
visible
naked
eye
disc
was
larger
than
jupiter
a
companion
to
the
star
somewhat
younger
and
larger
the
the
sun
around
which
it
swung
at
a
lordly
distance
hugh
blasted
back
killing
his
speed
over
many
sleeps
to
bring
the
ship
into
a
path
around
the
planet
the
maneuver
brought
him
close
enough
to
see
its
moons
luck
helped
him
again
he
had
planned
to
ground
the
great
planet
knowing
no
better
had
he
been
able
do
so
they
would
have
lived
just
long
enough
to
open
the
air
lock
but
he
was
short
of
mass
after
the
titanic
task
of
pulling
them
out
of
the
headlong
hyperbolic
plunge
around
an
arc
past
the
star
and
warping
them
into
a
closed
orbit
about
the
star
then
into
a
subordinate
orbit
around
the
giant
planet
he
pored
over
the
ancient
books
substituted
endlessly
in
the
equations
the
ancients
had
set
down
as
the
laws
for
moving
bodies
figured
and
refigured
and
tested
even
the
calm
patience
of
chloe
the
other
wife
the
unnamed
one
kept
out
of
his
way
after
losing
a
tooth
quite
suddenly
but
he
got
no
answer
that
did
not
require
him
to
sacrifice
some
at
least
of
the
precious
irreplaceable
ancient
books
for
fuel
yes
even
though
they
stripped
themselves
naked
and
chucked
in
their
knives
the
mass
of
the
books
would
still
be
needed
he
would
have
preferred
to
dispense
with
one
of
his
wives
he
decided
to
ground
on
one
of
the
moons
luck
again
coincidence
of
such
a
colossal
proportion
that
one
need
not
be
expected
to
believe
it
for
the
moon
of
that
planet
was
suitable
for
human
terrestrial
life
never
mind
skip
over
it
rapidly
the
combination
of
circumstances
is
of
the
same
order
needed
to
produce
such
a
planet
in
the
first
place
our
own
planet
under
our
own
sun
is
of
the
there
ain
t
no
such
animal
variety
it
is
a
ridiculous
improbability
hugh
s
luck
was
a
ridiculous
improbability
good
design
handled
the
next
phase
although
he
learned
to
maneuver
the
little
ship
out
in
space
where
there
is
elbow
room
landing
is
another
and
a
ticklish
matter
he
would
have
crashed
any
spacecraft
designed
before
the
designing
of
the
vanguard
but
the
designers
of
the
vanguard
had
known
that
the
ship
s
auxiliary
craft
would
be
piloted
and
grounded
by
at
least
the
second
generation
of
explorers
green
pilots
must
make
those
landings
unassisted
they
planned
for
it
hugh
got
the
vessel
down
into
the
stratosphere
and
straightened
it
triumphantly
into
a
course
that
would
with
certainty
kill
them
all
the
autopilots
took
over
hugh
stormed
and
swore
producing
some
words
which
diverted
alan
s
attention
and
admiration
from
the
view
out
of
the
port
but
nothing
he
could
do
would
cause
the
craft
to
respond
it
settled
in
its
own
way
and
leveled
off
at
a
thousand
feet
an
altitude
which
it
maintained
regardless
of
changing
contour
hugh
the
stars
are
gone
i
know
it
but
jordan
hugh
what
happened
to
them
hugh
glared
at
alan
i
don
t
know
and
i
don
t
care
you
get
aft
with
the
women
and
stop
asking
silly
questions
alan
departed
reluctantly
with
a
backward
look
at
the
surface
of
the
planet
and
the
bright
sky
it
interested
him
but
he
did
not
marvel
much
at
it
his
ability
to
marvel
had
been
overstrained
it
was
some
hours
before
hugh
discovered
that
a
hitherto
ignored
group
of
control
lights
set
in
motion
a
chain
of
events
whereby
the
autopilot
would
ground
the
ship
since
he
found
this
out
experimentally
he
did
not
exactly
choose
the
place
of
landing
but
the
unwinking
stereo
eyes
of
the
autopilot
fed
its
data
to
the
brain
the
submolar
mechanism
selected
and
rejected
the
ship
grounded
gently
on
a
rolling
high
prairie
near
a
clump
of
vegetation
ertz
came
forward
what
s
happened
hugh
hugh
waved
at
the
view
port
we
re
there
he
was
too
tired
to
make
much
of
it
too
tired
and
too
emotionally
exhausted
his
weeks
of
fighting
a
fight
he
understood
but
poorly
hunger
and
lately
thirst
years
of
feeding
on
a
consuming
ambition
these
left
him
with
little
ability
to
enjoy
his
goal
when
it
arrived
but
they
had
landed
they
had
finished
jordan
s
trip
he
was
not
unhappy
at
peace
rather
and
very
tired
ertz
stared
out
jordan
he
muttered
then
let
s
go
out
all
right
alan
came
forward
as
they
were
opening
the
air
lock
and
the
women
pressed
after
him
are
we
there
captain
shut
up
said
hugh
the
women
crowded
up
to
the
deserted
view
port
alan
explained
to
them
importantly
and
incorrectly
the
scene
outside
ertz
got
the
last
door
open
they
sniffed
at
the
air
it
s
cold
said
ertz
in
fact
the
temperature
was
perhaps
five
degrees
less
than
the
steady
monotony
of
the
ship
s
temperature
but
ertz
was
experiencing
weather
for
the
first
time
nonsense
said
hugh
faintly
annoyed
that
any
fault
should
be
found
with
_his_
planet
it
s
just
your
imagination
maybe
ertz
conceded
he
paused
uneasily
going
out
he
added
of
course
mastering
his
own
reluctance
hugh
pushed
him
aside
and
dropped
five
feet
to
the
ground
come
on
it
s
fine
ertz
joined
him
and
stood
close
to
him
both
of
them
remained
close
to
the
ship
it
s
big
isn
t
it
ertz
said
in
a
hushed
voice
well
we
knew
it
would
be
hugh
snapped
annoyed
with
himself
for
having
the
same
lost
feeling
hi
alan
peered
cautiously
out
of
the
door
can
i
comedown
is
it
alright
come
ahead
alan
eased
himself
gingerly
over
the
edge
and
joined
them
he
looked
around
and
whistled
gosh
their
first
sortie
took
them
all
of
fifty
feet
from
the
ship
they
huddled
close
together
for
silent
comfort
and
watched
their
feet
to
keep
from
stumbling
on
this
strange
uneven
deck
they
made
it
without
incident
until
alan
looked
up
from
the
ground
and
found
himself
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
with
nothing
close
to
him
he
was
hit
by
vertigo
and
acute
agoraphobia
he
moaned
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
what
in
the
ship
demanded
ertz
looking
around
then
it
hit
him
hugh
fought
against
it
it
pulled
him
to
his
knees
but
be
fought
it
steadying
himself
with
one
hand
on
the
ground
however
he
had
the
advantage
of
having
stared
out
through
the
view
port
for
endless
time
neither
alan
nor
ertz
were
cowards
alan
his
wife
shrilled
from
the
open
door
alan
come
back
here
alan
opened
one
eye
managed
to
get
it
focused
on
the
ship
and
started
inching
back
on
his
belly
man
commanded
hugh
stop
that
situp
alan
did
so
with
the
air
of
a
man
pushed
too
far
open
your
eyes
alan
obeyed
cautiously
reclosed
them
hastily
just
sit
still
and
you
ll
be
all
right
hugh
added
i
m
all
right
already
to
prove
it
he
stood
up
he
was
still
dizzy
but
he
made
it
ertz
sat
up
the
sun
had
crossed
a
sizable
piece
of
the
sky
enough
time
had
passed
for
a
well
fed
man
to
become
hungry
and
they
were
not
well
fed
even
the
women
were
outside
that
had
been
accomplished
by
the
simple
expedient
of
going
back
in
and
pushing
them
out
they
had
not
ventured
away
from
the
side
of
the
ship
but
sat
huddled
against
it
but
their
menfolk
had
even
learned
to
walk
singly
even
in
open
spaces
alan
thought
nothing
of
strutting
a
full
fifty
yards
away
from
the
shadow
of
the
ship
and
did
so
more
than
once
in
full
sight
of
the
women
it
was
on
one
such
journey
that
a
small
animal
native
to
the
planet
let
his
curiosity
exceed
his
caution
alan
s
knife
knocked
him
over
and
left
him
kicking
alan
scurried
to
the
spot
grabbed
his
fat
prize
by
one
leg
and
bore
it
proudly
back
to
hugh
look
hugh
look
good
eating
hugh
looked
with
approval
his
first
strange
fright
of
the
place
had
passed
and
had
been
replaced
with
a
deep
warm
feeling
a
feeling
that
he
had
come
at
last
to
his
long
home
this
seemed
a
good
omen
yes
he
agreed
good
eating
from
now
on
alan
always
good
eating
